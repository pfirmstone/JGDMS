<dt><b>The API Documentation is Now the Formal Specification</b>
<dd>

Previously, the formal specification for the <code>net.jini.entry</code>
package was a separate document. With this release, the formal specification
is the revised API Documentation. As part of this change the specification
language was generally cleaned up and made tighter.<p>

<dt><b>Behavior of Various <code>AbstractEntry</code> Methods Clarified</b>
<dd>

The previous versions of the specification for <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/entry/AbstractEntry.html">net.jini.entry.AbstractEntry</a></code>
did not specify how the static <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>,
and <code>toString</code> methods behaved if passed <code>null</code>
values. This version of the specification specifies that :

<ul>
<li> <code>equals</code> should return <code>true</code> if both
     arguments are <code>null</code>, and <code>false</code> if
     only one argument is <code>null</code>.
<li> <code>hashCode</code> should return <code>0</code> if passed
     <code>null</code>.
<li> <code>toString</code> should return <code>"null"</code> if
     passed <code>null</code>.
</ul>
<p>
Note: Previously our implementation of <code>AbstractEntry</code> would
throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> if any of these methods were
passed a <code>null</code> value.
<p>

Also, the specification of the static <code>toString</code> method was
changed to require that the returned string include the name of the
argument's class.

<dt><b> <code>UnusableEntriesException</code> Added</b>
<dd>

The <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/entry/UnusableEntriesException.html">net.jini.entry.UnusableEntriesException</a></code>
class was added. <code>UnusableEntriesException</code> can be used by
methods that normally return a collection of entries when one or more of
the entries can't be unmarshalled.
