  <dt> <b>Configuration</b>
  <dd> A new configuration entry named <code>roundTripTime</code> may
       be used to set the worst-case latency to assume for a remote
       call to renew a lease. This latency was previously hard-coded
       to a value of ten seconds.
       A full list of supported configuration entries is given in the
       <code>LeaseRenewalManager</code> <a
       href="../net/jini/lease/LeaseRenewalManager.html#configEntries">
       class documentation</a>. <p>

  <dt> <b>Logging</b>
  <dd> In this release, no changes have occurred with respect to the logging mechanism
       employed by the <code>LeaseRenewalManager</code>, which logs
       diagnostic information to the <a
       href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html">
       <code>Logger</code></a> named
       <code>net.jini.lease.LeaseRenewalManager</code>. A description of
       what information is logged at what logging levels is given in the
       <a
       href="../net/jini/lease/LeaseRenewalManager.html#logging">
       class documentation</a>.
  <p>
  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b>

  <dd> A number of bugs have been addressed in this release of the
       <code>LeaseRenewalManager.</code> What follows is a description of those
       bugs that might be of interest:
  <p>

  <dt><b>5015237: <code>LeaseRenewalManager</code> does not log lease
         renewal failures if no listener is specified</b><dt>

  <dd>The renewal failure logging code had an unnecessary dependency
      on the existence of a registered listener.
      <p>
      This bug has been fixed.
