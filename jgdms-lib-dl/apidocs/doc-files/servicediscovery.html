<H3>Description</H3>

The class
<a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>
is a utility class that can be used to help a Jini technology-enabled 
service or client (<i>Jini service</i> or <i>Jini client</i>) 
acquire services of interest that are registered with lookup services 
with which the service or client wishes to interact.
<p>
The specification for the
<a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>
utility is contained in the  <i>Jini Service Discovery Utilities Specification</i>, 
which is available in <a href="../specs/html/servicediscutil-spec.html">html</a>.

       <p>

  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b>
  <dd> A number of bugs have been addressed in this release of the
       service discovery manager. What follows is a description of those
       bugs that might be of interest:
  <p>

  <dt><b>4972100: SDM NPE in getServiceItems when blocking lookup called before
filter is applied</b><dt>
  <dd> When one of the blocking versions of the <code>lookup</code> method is
       invoked, there are conditions in which a <code>NullPointerException</code>
       can occur. One possible scenario in which this bug can occur is as follows:

<pre><code>SDM.lookup(duration)
  SDM creates cache ----- RegisterListenerTask(wait for events)
                          LookupTask begins
                            get snapshot (lookup state)
                            -- done --
wait(duration)
       *** start targetted service ***
                          NOMATCH_MATCH event received
                          NotifyEventTask (process event)
                          NewOldServiceTask (new service)
                            addToMap -- (item,null)
exit wait
call cach.lookup()
                            filterMaybeDiscard()
getServiceItems()
map(item,null) ===> NPE
                              filter -- map(item,filteredItem)</code></pre>

       If the timing is right, <code>getServiceItems</code> can be entered
       before the filter is applied and the non-<code>null</code>
       <code>filteredItem</code> is placed in the map. If this occurs,
       <code>getServiceItems</code> will attempt to access
       <code>filteredItem.srvc</code>, which will result in a
       <code>NullPointerException</code>.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>5102733: SDM cache.notifyServiceMap does not use event ID in its decision process</b><dt>
  <dd> Prior to this release, in the method
       <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager.LookupCacheImpl.notifyServiceMap</code>,
       only the sequence number of the new event and the sequence number stored
       in the <code>EventReg</code> element of the <code>eventRegMap</code> were       compared when determining whether or not there is a "gap" in the event
       sequence; in which case, a snapshot would be requested from the associated
       lookup service. This could result in multiple unnecessary snapshots being       requested; and thus, unnecessary network traffic and resource usage.
       <p>
       To understand how this problem could occur, consider the following scenario:

<pre>1 activatable lookup service registered with Phoenix (or RMID)
4 services registered with that lookup service
1 client using a cache to discover the services

>>> phoenix -stop (or rmid -stop) to stop the lookup service
>>> all 4 services eventually discard the lookup service
>>> the client eventually discards the lookup service
>>> restart phoenix (or rmid) before 30 minutes have expired
    (to restart the lookup service and recover its state before
    the client's original event registration [E0] has a chance
    to expire)</pre>

       When the client rediscovers the lookup service, its cache requests
       a new event registration [E1]. But the lookup service still has E0
       in its state.
       <p>
       When the services rediscover the lookup service, they reregister with
       the lookup service, and the lookup service sends a serviceAdded
       (<code>NOMATCH_MATCH</code>) event to both E0 and E1 for each of the
       services. The cache's event listener receives both sets of events.
       <p>
       Prior to fixing this bug, <code>notifyServiceMap</code> only analyzed the       sequence numbers of the events. It did not distinguish which event
       registration each event corresponded to. Because E0 was recovered after
       the lookup service went down and was restarted, the sequence numbers
       of the events sent to that registration were greater than
       <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, which resulted in a "gap" in the sequence so
       that clients would know that they might have missed events. Because E1 was
       not interrupted by a shutdown/restart, its sequence numbers started at 0.       Thus, when serviceAdded events arrived for E0 and for E1, the sequence
       looked something like the following to <code>notifyServiceMap</code>:

<pre>event 0 --> Service0 added: Event ID = 0 - seq# 2147483650
event 1 --> Service0 added: Event ID = 1 - seq# 0

event 2 --> Service1 added: Event ID = 0 - seq# 2147483651
event 3 --> Service1 added: Event ID = 1 - seq# 1

event 4 --> Service2 added: Event ID = 0 - seq# 2147483652
event 5 --> Service2 added: Event ID = 1 - seq# 2

event 6 --> Service3 added: Event ID = 0 - seq# 2147483653
event 7 --> Service3 added: Event ID = 1 - seq# 3</pre>

       Because <code>notifyServiceMap</code> did not consider the event ID,
       it appeared to <code>notifyServiceMap</code> that it was receiving a
       stream of events in which the sequence numbers looked like:

<pre>{ 2147483650, 0, 2147483651, 1, 2147483652, 2, 2147483653, 3 }</pre>

       To <code>notifyServiceMap</code>, the sequence appeared to be
       alternately "moving backward" and "moving forward" with a large
       gap. In each case though, <code>notifyServiceMap</code> interpreted
       the difference between sequence numbers as a gap; that is,

<pre>(if event_(n+1)_seq# != 1 + event_n_seq#, then a gap is declared).</pre>

       Thus, as each event was received, <code>notifyServiceMap</code>
       declared a gap, and a new snapshot was requested; which meant that for
       the four services, there were eight total snapshots requested.

       To address this bug, the method <code>notifyServiceMap</code> was
       modified to consider the event ID when determining whether or not
       an event sequence contains a gap; which now results in the appropriate
       behavior.

  <p>
  <dt><b>6208587: SDM should create default LDM only when no DiscoveryManagement is configured</b><dt>
  <dd> Prior to interrogating the configuration for a
       <a href="../net/jini/discovery/DiscoveryManagement.html"> <code>DiscoveryManagement</code></a>
       item (entry name = <b><i>discoveryManager</i></b>), a default
       <a href="../net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code></a>
       is first created. Although that manager is initialized to discover no groups and no locators,
       the <a href="../net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscovery.html"> <code>LookupDiscovery</code></a>
       instance used by the default discovery manager to perform group discovery creates
       a thread to listen for and process multicast announcements, as well as
       additional, related threads. Thus, if a deployer configures a <i>discoveryManagement</i>
       item, the creation of the default lookup discovery manager -- and the threads
       that manager ultimately creates -- is unnecessary, and wastes resources.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.

  <p>
  <dt> <b>Notes Of Interest</b>
  <dd>
       <p>
       <b>Note 1: Service Reference Comparison</b>
       <p>
       The ability to appropriately compare two different service references
       is very important to the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>
       in general, and the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       in particular. Currently, there are three mechanisms used to accurately
       compare service references. Each mechanism is applied in different situations,
       to achieve different goals.
       <p>
       When storing and managing service references, it is important to be able
       to determine when two different references (proxies) refer to the same
       back-end service (such references are referred to as <i>duplicates</i>)
       so that the storage and management of any duplicate references can be
       avoided. In addition to identifying duplicate references, the ability to
       determine when a previously discovered service has been replaced with a
       new version is also important so that consistent state may be maintained,       and entities that wish to know about such events can be informed.
       Finally, when an entity wishes to discard (make eligible for rediscovery)
       a particular service reference received from the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>,
       it is important for the <code>LookupCache</code> to be able to compare the
       reference provided by the entity to each of the previously stored references
       so that the appropriate reference can be accurately selected for discard.       <p>
       <b>Comparison by <a href="../net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html"> <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceID</code></a></b>
       <p>
       To identify, and thus avoid storing, duplicate service references, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       compares the instances of <a href="../net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html"> <code>ServiceID</code></a>
       associated with each reference. Recall that an individual well-behaved service of
       interest will usually register with multiple lookup services, and for
       each lookup service with which that service registers, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       will receive a separate event containing a reference to the service. When the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       receives events from multiple lookup services, the
       <a href="../net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html"> <code>ServiceID</code></a>
       (retrieved from the service reference in the event) is used to distinguish the
       service references from each other. In this way, when a new event arrives containing
       a reference associated with the same service as an already-stored reference,
       the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       can determine whether or not the new reference is a duplicate; in which case, the
       duplicate is ignored.
       <p>
       <b>Comparison by <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>net.jini.io.MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a></b>
       <p>
       With respect to determining when a previously discovered service has been
       replaced with a new version, the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a> typically relies
       on the event mechanism of the lookup service(s) with which that service is
       registered to indicate that such an event has occurred. But there are
       situations where the events from the lookup services do not provide enough
       information to make such a determination. In those cases, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a> employs
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       to make the determination.
       <p>
       When a well-behaved service is replaced with a new version, the new
       version is typically reregistered with each lookup service with
       which the old version is registered. As described in the
       <a href="../specs/html/lookup-spec.html"><i>Jini(TM) Lookup Service Specification</i></a>,
       each lookup service with which this reregistration process occurs first
       sends a service-removed event (<code>TRANSITION_MATCH_NOMATCH</code>), and
       then sends a separate service-added event (<code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code>).
       In this case, there is no ambiguity, and thus no need for the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       to compare the new and old service references. This is because the
       combination of service-removed and service-added events from each
       lookup service is an explicit indication that the service has been
       replaced. Note that, as described in the specification, the lookup
       service only sends a service-changed event (<code>TRANSITION_MATCH_MATCH</code>)
       when the attributes of the service have been modified; not when the
       service itself has been changed (replaced). Thus, if the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       receives a <code>TRANSITION_MATCH_MATCH</code> event, then it is guaranteed
       that the service referenced in that event has not been replaced with a new
       version.
       <p>
       Whenever the following conditions are satisfied, the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       will use <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       to compare two service references:
       <p>
         <ul>
           <li> The references are duplicates (same <a href="../net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html"> <code>ServiceID</code></a>)
           <li> The <b><i>possibility</i></b> exists that the references may refer to different versions of the service
         </ul>
       <p>
       When determining whether or not these conditions (in particular, the
       second condition) are satisfied, the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a> generally
       takes a conservative approach. That is, only when it is absolutely
       sure that two duplicates refer to the same version (such as when a
       <code>TRANSITION_MATCH_MATCH</code> event is received), will the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       refrain from using
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       to compare the duplicate references; otherwise, duplicate references are
       always compared using
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>.
       <p>
       One example of a situation where the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       employs <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       is the situation
       where a lookup service of interest is newly discovered or rediscovered.
       In this situation, the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       retrieves a snapshot of the services of interest that currently reside in that
       lookup service. This is done so that previously undiscovered service references,
       as well as new versions of previously discovered service references, can
       both be stored, duplicates can be ignored, and clients can be sent the
       appropriate notifications. Whenever a reference from the snapshot is a
       duplicate of a previously discovered service reference, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       always compares the two references using
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>.
       This is because the possibility always exists that the references may refer to different
       versions of the service.
       <p>
       Another example of a situation where the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       employs <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       is when a <code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code> event is received that
       contains a reference that is a duplicate of a previously discovered
       reference. When such an event is received, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       must allow for the possibility that the reference contained
       in the event refers to a different version of the service
       than that referenced by the previously discovered service reference.
       This is because the event may represent either the second half of a
       <code>TRANSITION_MATCH_NOMATCH</code>/<code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code>
       (remove/add) event pair, or it may be a notification of the initial
       registration of a new version of the service with one of the (multiple)
       lookup services targeted by the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       during the service discovery process.
       <p>
       To understand the last example described above, consider the situation
       where a service initially registers with one lookup service and then
       registers with a second lookup service. If the same version of the
       service is registered with each lookup service, both lookup services
       will send the same event -- a <code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code>
       event -- to indicate that a new service has registered with the
       associated lookup service. In this case, there is no ambiguity for the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>;
       the second reference can be safely ignored because the references are
       duplicates that refer to the exact same service.
       <p>
       But suppose that prior to registering with the second lookup service,
       the service is replaced with a new version. In that case, the second
       lookup service will still send a <code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code> event, but
       if the appropriate action is not taken to determine that the old version
       of the service has been replaced, the new version of the service will
       be ignored by the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>.
       This is because the two references will have the same
       <a href="../net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html"> <code>ServiceID</code></a>,
       and thus the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       will identify the two references as duplicates; ultimately ignoring the new reference.
       Of course, if the service is well-behaved, because the new version of the service will
       eventually reregister with the first lookup service, that lookup service
will
       eventually send a <code>TRANSITION_MATCH_NOMATCH</code> event followed by a
       <code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code> event to indicate that the service
has been
       replaced. But the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       must still identify and handle this situation in order to prevent possible state
       corruption, even though that corruption may be only temporary.
       <p>
       Thus, whenever a <code>TRANSITION_NOMATCH_MATCH</code> event is received
and the
       associated service reference is a duplicate of a previously discovered
       reference, the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       will always compare the two references using
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       to determine whether or not the references refer to the same version of the service.
       When they do reference the same version, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       ignores the duplicate reference; otherwise, the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       sends a service-removed event followed by a service-added event to indicate
       that the old version of the service has been replaced.
       <p>
       <b>Comparison by <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a></b>
       <p>
       The mechanism employed by the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a> to select (from
       storage) a given reference for discard is the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       method provided by the discovered service itself. The
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       relies on the provider of each service to override the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       method with an implementation that allows
       for the identification of the service reference an entity wishes to
       be discarded. Although the default implementation of
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       often times may be sufficient for proper identification, service providers
       are still encouraged to provide each service with its own well-defined
       implementation of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>.
       <p>
       In addition to the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       method, each service should also
       provide a proper implementation of the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode"> <code>hashCode</code></a> method.
       This is because references to the service may be stored in, or interact with,
       container classes (for example,
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html"> <code>HashMap</code></a>)
       where the service's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode"> <code>hashCode</code></a>
       methods may be invoked "under the covers" by the container object with
       which the service is interacting. From the point of view of the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>
       and the <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>,
       providing an appropriate implementation for both the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals"> <code>equals</code></a>
       method and the
       <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode"> <code>hashCode</code></a>
       method is a key characteristic of good behavior in a Jini service.

       <p>
       <b>Note 2: The Service Discovery Filtering Mechanism</b>
       <p>
       The specification of the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceItemFilter.html"> <code>ServiceItemFilter</code></a>
       interface specifies what it means to <i>filter</i> a service reference selected as a
       candidate for discovery. In particular, instances of
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceItemFilter.html"> <code>ServiceItemFilter</code></a>
       can be defined to perform proxy preparation. Thus, through the client-defined filter
       (through the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceItemFilter.html#check"> <code>check</code></a>
       method), clients can request that the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>,
       rather than the client itself, perform any desired proxy preparation
       as part of the service discovery process.
       <p>
       To understand why this is important, consider what can happen when
       the client performs preparation of its discovered proxies outside of the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>.
       When proxy preparation is performed outside of the service discovery
       manager, the client risks encountering a cycle where a matching service is
       discovered by the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>,
       is found to be untrusted when the client prepares the proxy, is discarded       by the client because it is untrusted, and is then ultimately rediscovered
       because it still matches the original discovery criteria. Such a cycle
       will generally repeat indefinitely because the service is not likely to
       become trusted at any point in the future. Supplying the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code></a>
       with the means to perform proxy preparation on the client's behalf
       provides the client with a mechanism for avoiding such a cycle.

       <b>Note 3: The Service Discovery Event Mechanism</b>
       <p>
       The specification of the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryListener.html"> <code>ServiceDiscoveryListener</code></a>
       interface describes how the filtering mechanism and the event mechanism provided by instances of
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>net.jini.lookup.LookupCache</code></a>
       interact.
       <p>
       Additionally, this specification specifies that instances of the
       <a href="../net/jini/lookup/LookupCache.html"> <code>LookupCache</code></a>
       use the method
       <a href="../net/jini/io/MarshalledInstance.html"> <code>net.jini.io.MarshalledInstance.fullyEquals</code></a>
       to determine when a service has changed in some fundamental way (for example,
       when a service is replaced with a new version).

        <td><p>LookupCache.terminate() can cause an InternalError in the task
                thread.</p>
            <p>
                Prior to fixing this bug, the service discovery manager passed 
                the listener implementation, rather than its stub, to the lookup 
                service proxy's notify method.  Under normal circumstances,
                RMI automatically replaces the implementation with the stub,
                assuming the implementation is exported.  However when the
                terminate method on a LookupCache is called, the implementation
                gets unexported and, because of the way the service discovery manager
                manages its task queue, terminate doesn't manage to do anything
                about in-progress or pending tasks for the LookupCache, such as
                calling notify.</p>
            <p>
                Because of the change that went into Java 2 SDK, v 1.2.2, if a
                remote object isn't a stub and isn't an exported implementation,
                RMI will simply try to marshal it rather than throwing a
                StubNotFoundException.  However, the service discovery manager's
                listener implementation extends UnicastRemoteObject, which
                ultimately extends RemoteObject, and RemoteObject has a writeObject
                method that throws an InternalError (because prior to the 1.2.2
                change, this wasn't supposed to be able to happen.

        <td>ServiceDiscoveryManager: An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException can occur because
        totalMatches is used as the number of discovered services to process rather than
        items.length.<p>
            Prior to fixing this bug, the service discovery manager assumed that
            the value of ServiceMatches.items.length as the number of services returned from a 
            query on a number of services returned from a query on a lookup service.
            This meant that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could occur if totalMatches
            ever exceeded the number of services actually returned (which can
            happen when more services matching the template are currently
            registered than the maximum number of services requested.

        <td><p>Two versions of ServiceDiscoveryManager.lookup contain a potential
                race condition.</p>
            <p>
                When one of the blocking lookup methods (that takes a waitDur 
                argument) is called, the method starts tasks to send events to
                the internal ServiceDiscoveryListener when a matching services
                appear, and then waits in a loop for notifications to occur.
                The call to object.notifyAll that interrupts the waiting thread
                is made in the ServiceDiscoveryListener when remote events 
                arrive signaling state changes related to services of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to fixing this bug, the call to notifyAll was not guaranteed to always
                occur after the waiting thread entered the wait state.  If the call
                to notifyAll happened to occur prior to the wait state being
                entered, then the lookup method could unnecessarily block for the
                full amount of time.

            <p>
                Prior to fixing this bug, if an exception occurred in one of the
                tasks being executed by the service discovery manager's task
                thread, the exception was not caught, the encompassing task
                thread would die, and no more tasks would be executed, 
                rendering the current instance of the service discovery manager
                incapable of processing any more tasks.  With this bug fix,
                not only are such exceptions trapped, but if debugging is 
                enabled, the stack trace will be displayed.
