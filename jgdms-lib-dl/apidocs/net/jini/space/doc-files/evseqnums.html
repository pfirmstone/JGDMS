<h1>Note on JavaSpaces Technology, Persistent Outrigger Services, and Event Sequence Numbers
</h1>
</center>
<p>
Previously the <i>JavaSpaces Service Specification</i> required that
event sequence numbers associated with spaces events to be <em>fully
ordered</em>.  Fully ordered, as defined in the <i>River Distributed
Event Specification</i>, requires that:
<blockquote>
	... not only do sequence numbers increase, but they are not
	skipped. In such a case, if <code>RemoteEvent</code> <I>x</I>
	and <I>y</I> have the same source and the same event
	identifier, and <I>x</I> has sequence number <I>m</I> and
	<I>y</I> has sequence number <I>n</I>, then if <I>m</I> <
	<I>n</I> there were exactly <I>n</I>-<I>m</I>-1 events of the
	same event type between the event that triggered <I>x</I> and
	the event that triggered <I>y</I>. Such sequence numbers are
	said to be "fully ordered."

</blockquote>
<p>
In the Fall of 2000, we received feedback (from Asaf Kariv of GigaSpaces
Technologies Ltd.) stating that requiring event sequence numbers to be fully
ordered places too high a burden on implementors of the <i>JavaSpaces
Service Specification</i> (GigaSpaces is a vender of a commercial JavaSpaces
service implementation).  For example, the guarantee requires a persistent
implementation to store sufficient information <em>during</em> each
<code>write</code> so that after a crash it can know the event
registrations matched by that <code>write</code>. This requirement
places a significant restriction on what implementation strategies are
practical.
<p>
An additional wrinkle was that at the time, the persistent version of Outrigger
itself did not generate fully ordered event sequence numbers in all cases.
While we believe we could have fixed this issue in
the Outrigger codebase with minimal performance impact, serving only
our own needs would not promote our goal of having JavaSpaces
implementations from a number of vendors.
<p>
After substantial discussions within the Jini Community(SM) for more than a
year, we came to the conclusion that weakening the fully ordered guarantee
would be unlikely to have significant negative impact on users of
JavaSpaces technology. As a result, in the 1.2 FCS release,  
we changed the <i>JavaSpaces
Service Specification</i> so that only the basic guarantee required by the
<i>Jini Distributed Event Specification</i> on event sequences numbers
is called for. This basic guarantee requires that all sequence numbers are
unique and ordered, but that gaps in the sequence do not necessarily imply
that events have been missed.  Put another way, if two remote events
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I> come from the same source and have the same event
identifier, then <I>x</I> occurred before <I>y</I>, if and only if, the
sequence number of <I>x</I> is less than the sequence number of <I>y</I>,
but the difference between the two sequence numbers implies nothing about
how many events may or may not have occurred between <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>.
<p>
A related issue is that previous editions of the <i>JavaSpaces Service
Specification</i> specifically allowed implementations to "compress" event
deliveries because sequence numbers were fully ordered. This rasises the
questions &#151; is compression still allowed? and should we be
calling it out in the specification? It was decided that the event
specification does allow for event notifications to be dropped even when
only the basic sequence number guarantee is present, and that it was not
necessary to call this possibility out in the <i>JavaSpaces Service
Specification</i>.

<h2>What This Means for Persistent Outrigger Services</h2>

As alluded to above, the persistent version of Outrigger did not generate
fully ordered sequence numbers in all cases; indeed, in these cases it did
not even meet the basic guarantee because it sometimes assigned the same
sequence number to different events. What was especially troubling is that,
in these cases, the client had no way of detecting that the same sequence
number had been assigned to more than one event.
<p>
In the 1.2 beta release, Outrigger was changed to be
<em>delta-well-ordered</em>.  With delta-well-ordered sequence
numbers, if two remote events <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> with the same type and
source have sequence numbers that differ by less than some delta <I>D</I>
(typically a large number), then the number of intervening values between
the sequence numbers of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> would be equal to the number
of intervening events.  If the difference is larger than <I>D</I>, then no
inference about the number of intervening events could be made.
<p>
More formally, the characterization is:
<blockquote>

    Let <I>e</I>(<I>n</I>) and <I>e</I>(<I>m</I>) be notifications of
    an event of type <I>e</I> from the same event generator with
    sequence numbers <I>n</I> and <I>m</I>, and let <I>D</I> be some
    integer. If |<I>n</I> - <I>m</I>| < <I>D</I>, then the number of
    events that occurred between the events that triggered
    notifications <I>e</I>(<I>n</I>) and <I>e</I>(<I>m</I>) is
    |<I>n</I> - <I>m</I>| - 1.

</blockquote>
<p>
The delta-well-ordered guarantee lets the implementation deliver a
fully ordered guarantee where possible, but not where it becomes too
burdensome.  For example, a persistent implementation might be fully
ordered in the usual case, incrementing the sequence number by one, but
efficient during crash recovery by incrementing the sequence number by
<I>D</I>.
<p>

In Outrigger, we insert a delta only after the server comes up from a
crash (Reggie uses a similar implementation strategy).  
<p>

Note that this will affect any existing code that assumes it can
calculate the number of intervening events by subtracting sequence
numbers.  If your existing code is using persistent Outrigger
across a crash, such code might be surprised to suddenly find
that a few billion events seem to have transpired while it wasn't
looking.  The discussions within the Jini Community have yet to locate a
critical dependency of this form, but one is possible.
