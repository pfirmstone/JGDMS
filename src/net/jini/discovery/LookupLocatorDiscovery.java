/**
 * This class encapsulates the functionality required of an entity that
 * wishes to employ the unicast discovery protocol to discover a lookup
 * service. This utility provides an implementation that makes the process
 * of finding specific lookup services much simpler for both services and
 * clients.
 * <p>
 * Because this class participates in only the unicast discovery protocol,
 * and because the unicast discovery protocol imposes no restriction on the
 * physical location of the entity relative to a lookup service, this utility
 * can be used to discover lookup services running on hosts that are located
 * far from, or near to, the host on which the entity is running. This lack
 * of a restriction on location brings with it a requirement that the
 * discovering entity supply this class with specific information about the
 * desired lookup services; namely, the location of the device(s) hosting
 * each lookup service. This information is supplied through an instance
 * of the {@link net.jini.core.discovery.LookupLocator LookupLocator} class,
 * or its subclass {@link net.jini.discovery.ConstrainableLookupLocator
 * ConstrainableLookupLocator}.
