Provides implementations of {@link net.jini.jeri.Endpoint} and {@link
net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint} that use TLS/SSL and HTTPS (HTTP over
TLS/SSL) to support invocation constraints. <p>

The package includes two <code>ServerEndpoint</code> classes to support
the server side of remote connections, {@link
net.jini.jeri.ssl.SslServerEndpoint} for direct communication over TCP
sockets using TLS/SSL (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt"
target="_top">Secure Socket Layer</a>), and {@link
net.jini.jeri.ssl.HttpsServerEndpoint} for communication through
firewalls using HTTPS (<a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt">Hypertext Transfer Protocol
encapsulated in the TLS/SSL protocol</a>), with the associated
<code>Endpoint</code> classes, {@link net.jini.jeri.ssl.SslEndpoint} and
{@link net.jini.jeri.ssl.HttpsEndpoint}. <p>

The package includes the {@link
net.jini.jeri.ssl.ConfidentialityStrength} constraint, supported by the
endpoints in the package, for specifying requirements or preferences for
weak or strong confidentiality on remote connections. <p>

The package also includes the {@link
net.jini.jeri.ssl.SslTrustVerifier} trust verifier for establishing
trust in remote proxies that use instances of the endpoint and
constraint classes supplied in this package, as well as principals of
type <code>X500Principal</code>. <p>

<a name="supported_constraints"><h2>Supported Constraints</h2></a>

The endpoint classes in this package support at least the following
constraints, possibly limited by the available cipher suites: <p>

<ul>
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientAuthentication}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMaxPrincipal}, when it
     contains an {@link javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMaxPrincipalType}, when it
     contains <code>X500Principal</code>
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMinPrincipal}, when it
     contains a single <code>X500Principal</code> only
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMinPrincipalType}, when it
     contains <code>X500Principal</code> only
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Confidentiality}
<li> {@link net.jini.jeri.ssl.ConfidentialityStrength}, a
     provider-specific constraint for specifying weak or strong
     confidentiality
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConnectionAbsoluteTime}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConnectionRelativeTime}, trivially
     on the server side, since this only takes effect on the client side
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConstraintAlternatives}, if the
     elements all have the same actual class and at least one element
     is supported
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Delegation#NO}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Delegation#YES}, trivially, for
     anonymous clients
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.DelegationAbsoluteTime}, trivially,
     when delegation is not supported
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.DelegationRelativeTime}, trivially
     on the server side, when delegation is not supported
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Integrity#YES}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerAuthentication}
<li> {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerMinPrincipal}, when it
     contains a single <code>X500Principal</code> only
</ul> <p>

Note that {@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConnectionRelativeTime} and
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.DelegationRelativeTime} constraints may
be used on the client side at higher levels, but should be converted to
the associated absolute time constraints for use by the
<code>Endpoint</code> classes. <p>

<a name="subject_authentication"><h2>Subject Authentication</h2></a>

The endpoint classes authenticate as a single {@link
java.security.Principal} if the following items are present in the
{@link javax.security.auth.Subject}: <p>

<ul>
<li> One or more principals of type <code>X500Principal</code>
<li> For each principal, one or more certificate chains, stored as
     public credentials, and represented by instances of {@link
     java.security.cert.CertPath}, whose <code>getType</code> method
     returns "X.509", and for which calling <code>getSubjectDN</code> on
     the certificate chain's first element returns that principal's name
<li> For each certificate chain, an instance of {@link
     javax.security.auth.x500.X500PrivateCredential}, stored as a
     private credential, whose <code>getCertificate</code> method
     returns a value equal to the first element of the certificate
     chain, and whose <code>getPrivateKey</code> method returns the
     associated private key
</ul> <p>

In addition, the {@link net.jini.jeri.Endpoint#newRequest newRequest}
methods for the client endpoint classes will only authenticate as a
given principal if the caller has been granted {@link
net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission} with that principal as the
local principal, the principal representing the authenticated identity
of the server as the peer principal, and the <code>connect</code>
action. <p>

Similarly, the server endpoint classes will only dispatch remote calls
that authenticate as a given principal if the caller of {@link
net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint.ListenEndpoint#listen listen} on their
{@link net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint.ListenEndpoint ListenEndpoint} has
been granted <code>AuthenticationPermission</code> with that principal
as the local principal, the principal representing the authenticated
identity of the client for the call (if any) as the peer principal, and
the <code>accept</code> action. <p>

These endpoint classes support remote connections between authenticated
servers and authenticated or anonymous clients, and between anonymous
servers and anonymous clients. Connections between anonymous servers and
authenticated clients are not supported. Because of the suites available
in the TLS/SSL protocol, support for {@link
net.jini.core.constraint.Confidentiality#NO} requires the server to
authenticate with an RSA public key. <p>

If the server subject contains principals and credentials that would
permit authentication of more than one <code>X500Principal</code>, the
endpoint will make an arbitrary choice of the principal to use for
authentication, and will continue to make the same choice so long as
subject contents, validity of credentials, and security permissions do
not change. <p>

If there is a security manager, the {@link
net.jini.jeri.OutboundRequestIterator#next OutboundRequestIterator.next}
methods defined on the iterators returned by calling the {@link
net.jini.jeri.Endpoint#newRequest newRequest} methods on the client
endpoints call the security manager's {@link
java.lang.SecurityManager#checkConnect checkConnect} method with the
endpoint's server host and port. <p>

Similarly, if there is a security manager, the {@link
net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint.ListenEndpoint#checkPermissions
checkPermissions} and {@link
net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint.ListenEndpoint#listen listen} methods
defined on <code>ListenEndpoint</code> instances returned by the server
endpoints call the security manager's {@link
java.lang.SecurityManager#checkListen checkListen} method, as well as
requiring the caller to have <code>AuthenticationPermission</code> with
all the server principals specified in the server endpoint and the
<code>listen</code> action. <p>

The host name specified when creating <code>SslServerEndpoint</code> or
<code>HttpsServerEndpoint</code> instances controls the host name that
will be contained in associated <code>Endpoint</code> instances produced
when {@link net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint#enumerateListenEndpoints
ServerEndpoint.enumerateListenEndpoints} is invoked to listen on the
server endpoint; the host name does not affect the behavior of the
listen operation itself, which listens on all of the local system's
network addresses. If the host name in the server endpoint is
<code>null</code>, then the host name in the endpoint instances that it
produces will be the default server host name, which is the IP address
string of the {@link java.net.InetAddress} returned by {@link
java.net.InetAddress#getLocalHost InetAddress.getLocalHost} when
<code>enumerateListenEndpoints</code> is invoked. <p>

The client and server endpoint classes permit specifying a {@link
javax.net.SocketFactory} for creating the {@link java.net.Socket}
instances that client endpoints use to make remote connections back to
the server. The server endpoints permit specifying a {@link
javax.net.ServerSocketFactory} for creating the {@link
java.net.ServerSocket} instances that the server endpoint uses to accept
remote connections. These socket factories and sockets should not
implement the TLS/SSL protocol; it is the responsibility of the
implementation to establish TLS/SSL connections over the sockets it
obtains from the socket factories. In particular, instances of {@link
javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory} and {@link
javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocketFactory} should not be used, and the
factories used should not return instances of {@link
javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket} or {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLServerSocket}. <p>

A <code>SocketFactory</code> used with instances of the endpoint classes
should be serializable, and must implement {@link
java.lang.Object#equals Object.equals} to obey the guidelines that are
specified for <code>equals</code> methods of {@link
net.jini.jeri.Endpoint} instances. A <code>ServerSocketFactory</code>
used with instances of the server endpoint classes must implement
<code>Object.equals</code> to obey the guidelines that are specified for
<code>equals</code> methods of {@link
net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint.ListenEndpoint ListenEndpoint}
instances. <p>

The <code>HttpsEndpoint</code> class recognizes the following system
properties: <p>

<ul>
<li> https.proxyHost - The host name for the secure proxy server. The
     default is to use no proxy server.
<li> https.proxyPort - The port for the secure proxy server. The default
     is 443.
<li> http.nonProxyHosts - The names of hosts for which direct
     connections should be made rather than using the proxy server. Each
     host name may contain '<code>*</code>' wildcard characters in any
     position to match zero or more of any characters within the
     name. Multiple host names may be specified by separating the names
     with '<code>|</code>' characters. The default is for all
     connections to use the proxy server if one is specified.
</ul>

The <code>SslEndpoint</code> and <code>SslServerEndpoint</code> classes
use the <a href="../connection/doc-files/mux.html">Jini extensible
remote invocation (Jini ERI) multiplexing protocol</a> to map outgoing
requests to socket connections.

This implementation uses the following security providers: <p>

<ul>
<li> {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext}, with the protocol specified by
     the <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.sslProtocol</code> system property,
     or <code>"TLSv1.2"</code> if that property is not defined, to provide
     the TLS/SSL implementation. The {@link
     javax.net.ssl.SSLContext#init SSLContext.init} method is called
     with <code>null</code> for the <code>random</code> parameter to use
     the default {@link java.security.SecureRandom} implementation.
<li> {@link java.security.cert.CertificateFactory}, with type
     <code>"X.509"</code>, to generate <code>CertPath</code> instances
     from X.509 certificate chains
<li> {@link javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory}, with the algorithm
     specified by the
     <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.trustManagerFactoryAlgorithm</code>
     system property, or the default algorithm if that property is not
     defined, to implement trust management for the TLS/SSL
     implementation. The factory must return trust managers that
     implement {@link javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager}.
</ul> <p>

See the documentation on <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#ProviderInstalling"
target="_top">installing security providers</a> and <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#ProviderCust"
target="_top">configuring JSSE</a> for information on configuring these
providers. <p>

The <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Customization"
target="_top">JSSE documentation</a> also describes the system
properties for configuring the location, type, and password of the
truststore that the endpoints use, through JSSE, to make decisions about
what certificate chains should be trusted. <p>

Both the TLS/SSL and HTTPS implementations recognize the following
system properties: <p>

<ul>
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.maxServerSessionDuration</code> - The
     maximum number of milliseconds a server-side TLS/SSL session should
     be used before expiring. The default is 24 hours. The value used
     should be larger than the maximum client session duration to allow
     the client to negotiate a new session before the server timeout
     occurs.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.maxClientSessionDuration</code> - The
     maximum number of milliseconds a client-side TLS/SSL session should
     be used. The default is 23.5 hours. The value should be smaller
     than the maximum server session duration to allow the client to
     negotiate a new session before the server timeout occurs.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.sslProtocol</code> - The secure socket
     protocol used when obtaining {@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext}
     instances. The default is <code>"TLSv1.2"</code>.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.trustManagerFactoryAlgorithm</code> -
     The algorithm used when obtaining {@link
     javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory} instances. The default is the
     value returned by {@link
     javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm
     TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm}.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.ssl.cipherSuites</code> - The TLS/SSL
     cipher suites that should be used for communication. The default is
     the list of suites supported by the JSSE implementation. The value
     should specify the suite names, separated by commas. The value will
     be ignored if it contains no suites or specifies suites that are
     not supported by the JSSE implementation. Suites appearing earlier
     in the list will be preferred to ones appearing later for suites
     that support the same requirements and preferences.
</ul> <p>

The following system properties are recognized by HTTPS implementation
only: <p>

<ul>
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.idleConnectionTimeout</code> - The
     number of milliseconds to retain idle client-side HTTPS connections
     before closing them. The default is <code>15000</code>.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.idleServerConnectionTimeout</code> -
     The number of milliseconds to retain idle server-side HTTPS
     connections before closing them.  The default is the idle
     client-side connection timeout (as specified by the
     <code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.idleConnectionTimeout</code> system
     property) plus <code>30000</code>.
<li> <code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.responseAckTimeout</code> - The
     number of milliseconds to wait for acknowledgments from {@link
     net.jini.io.context.AcknowledgmentSource} instances, or to keep
     track of acknowledgements that have not yet been sent. The default
     is <code>15000</code>.
<li><code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.pingProxyConnections</code> - If
    the value is case-insensitive equal to <code>true</code>, then if an
    HTTP proxy is being used, ping the server endpoint to verify whether
    it is alive and reachable. The ping occurs before the first request
    and before each subsequent request which follows the expiration of
    the ping proxy timeout period (below) following the previous ping.
    When using an HTTP proxy it is often impossible to distinguish
    between inability to reach the server endpoint (such as because the
    server process refused a connection by the HTTP proxy) and the lack
    of response from a delivered request (which might result in an
    UnmarshalException). The ping increases the likelihood that the
    inability to reach the server endpoint can be explicitly identified.
    The default value is <code>false</code>, and no pings are done.
<li><code>org.apache.river.jeri.https.pingProxyConnectionTimeout</code> - The
    number of milliseconds from the time a server endpoint was last
    pinged before a ping will precede the next request. The default is
    <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code> (essentially meaning, ping only before
    the first request).
</ul>
