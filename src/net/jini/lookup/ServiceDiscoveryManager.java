/**
 * The <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class is a helper utility class
 * that any client-like entity can use to "discover" services registered
 * with any number of lookup services of interest. On behalf of such
 * entities, this class maintains - as much as possible - up-to-date
 * state information about both the lookup services the entity wishes
 * to query, and the services the entity wishes to acquire and use.
 * By maintaining current service state information, the entity can
 * implement efficient mechanisms for service access and usage.
 * <p>
 * There are three basic usage patterns for this class. In order of
 * importance and typical usage, those patterns are:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The entity requests that the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>
 *        create a cache (an instance of
 *        {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache}) which will
 *        asynchronously "discover", and locally store, references
 *        to services that match criteria defined by the entity; services
 *        which are registered with one or more lookup services managed
 *        by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> on behalf of the entity.
 *        The cache can be viewed as a set of service references that the
 *        entity can access locally as needed through one of the public,
 *        non-remote methods provided in the cache's interface. Thus, rather
 *        than making costly remote queries of multiple lookup services at
 *        the point in time when the entity needs the service, the entity
 *        can simply make local queries on the cache for the services that
 *        the cache acquired and stored at a prior time. An entity should
 *        employ this pattern when the entity must make <i>frequent</i>
 *        queries for multiple services. By populating the cache with
 *        multiple instances of the desired services, redundancy in the
 *        availability of those services can be provided. Thus, if an
 *        instance of a service is found to be unavailable when needed,
 *        the entity can execute a local query on the cache rather than
 *        one or more remote queries on the lookup services to acquire
 *        an instance that is available. To employ this pattern, the entity
 *        invokes the method
 *        {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#createLookupCache
 *        createLookupCache}.
 *   <li> The entity can register with the event mechanism provided by the
 *        <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. This event mechanism allows the
 *        entity to request that it be notified when a service of interest
 *        is discovered for the first time, or has encountered a state change
 *        such as removal from all lookup services, or attribute set changes.
 *        Although interacting with a local cache of services in the way
 *        described in the first pattern can be very useful to entities that
 *        need frequent access to multiple services, some client-like
 *        entities may wish to interact with the cache in a reactive manner.
 *        For example, an entity such as a service browser typically wishes
 *        to be notified of the arrival of new services of interest as well
 *        as any changes in the state of the current services in the cache.
 *        In these situations, polling for such changes is usually viewed as
 *        undesirable. If the cache were to also provide an event mechanism
 *        with notification semantics, the needs of entities that employ
 *        either pattern can be satisfied. To employ this pattern, the entity
 *        must create a cache and supply it with an instance of the
 *        {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryListener
 *        ServiceDiscoveryListener} interface that will receive instances of
 *        {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryEvent ServiceDiscoveryEvent}
 *        when events of interest, related to the services in the cache, occur.
 *   <li> The entity, through the public API of the
 *        <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>, can directly query the lookup
 *        services managed by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> for
 *        services of interest; employing semantics similar to the semantics
 *        employed in a typical lookup service query made through the
 *        {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar}
 *        interface. Such queries will result in a remote call being made at
 *        the same time the service is needed (unlike the first pattern, in
 *        which remote calls typically occur prior to the time the service is
 *        needed). This pattern may be useful to entities needing to find
 *        services on an infrequent basis, or when the cost of making a remote
 *        call is outweighed by the overhead of maintaining a local cache (for
 *        example, due to limited resources). Although an entity that needs
 *        to query lookup service(s) can certainly make such queries through
 *        the {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar}
 *        interface, the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> provides a broad
 *        API with semantics that are richer than the semantics of the
 *        {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar#lookup lookup} methods
 *        provided by the {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar
 *        ServiceRegistrar}. This API encapsulates functionality that many
 *        client-like entities may find more useful when managing both the set
 *        of desired lookup services, and the service queries made on those
 *        lookup services. To employ this pattern, the entity simply
 *        instantiates this class with the desired parameters, and then
 *        invokes the appropriate version of the
 *        {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#lookup lookup}
 *        method when the entity wishes to acquire a service that matches
 *        desired criteria.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All three mechanisms just described - local queries on the cache,
 * service discovery notification, and remote lookups - employ the same
 * template-matching scheme as that employed in the
 * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar} interface.
 * Additionally, each mechanism allows the entity to supply an object
 * referred to as a <i>filter</i>; an instance of
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceItemFilter ServiceItemFilter}. A filter
 * is a non-remote object that defines additional matching criteria that the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> applies when searching for the
 * entity's services of interest. Employing a filter is particularly useful
 * to entities that wish to extend the capabilities of the standard
 * template-matching scheme.
 * <p>
 * In addition to (or instead of) employing a filter to apply additional
 * matching criteria to candidate service proxies initially found through
 * template matching, filters can also be used to extend the selection
 * process so that only proxies that are <i>safe</i> to use are returned
 * to the entity. To do this, the entity would use the
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceItemFilter ServiceItemFilter} interface to
 * supply the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> or
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache} with a filter that,
 * when applied to a candidate proxy, performs a set of operations that
 * is referred to as <i>proxy preparation</i>. As described in the
 * documentation for {@link net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer}, proxy
 * preparation typically includes operations such as, verifying trust
 * in the proxy, specifying client constraints, and dynamically granting
 * necessary permissions to the proxy.
 * <p>
 * Note that this utility class is not remote. Clients and services that wish
 * to use this class will create an instance of this class in their own address
 * space to manage the state of discovered services and their associated
 * lookup services locally.

 *
 * This implementation of <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> supports
 * the following configuration entries; where each configuration entry
 * name is associated with the component name
 * <code>net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. Note that the
 * configuration entries specified here are specific to this implementation
 * of <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. Unless otherwise stated, each
 * entry is retrieved from the configuration only once per instance of this
 * utility, where each such retrieval is performed in the constructor.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that in addition to allowing a client of this
 * utility to request - through the public API - the creation of a cache
 * that is used externally by the client, this utility also creates
 * instances of the cache that are used internally by the utility itself.
 * As such, in addition to the configuration entries that are used only
 * in this utility (and not in any cache), and the configuration entries
 * that are retrieved during the construction of each new cache (and used
 * by only that cache), there are configuration entries specified below
 * that are retrieved once during the construction of this utility, but
 * which are shared with, and used by, the caches that are created.

         *  in the event sequence, creates and places on the queue, either a
         *  LookupTask (if a gap was found) or a NotifyTask.
         *
         *  Recall that the Event specification states that if the sequence
         *  numbers of two successive events differ by only 1, then one can
         *  be assured that no events were missed. On the other hand, if
         *  the difference is greater than 1 (the sequence contains a "gap"),
         *  then one or more events may -- or may not -- have been missed.
         *  Thus, if a gap is found in the events, although it's possible that
         *  no events were missed, this method takes the conservative approach
         *  by assuming events were missed. When this method determines that
         *  an event may have been missed, it requests a current "snapshot"
         *  of the given ServiceRegistrar's state by queueing the execution
         *  of a LookupTask. Since this method can safely assume that no
         *  events have been missed if it finds no gaps in the event sequence,
         *  this method queues the notification of the entity by requesting
         *  the execution of a NotifyEventTask.
         *
         *  Note that when a lookup service is discovered, this utility
         *  registers with that lookup service's event mechanism for service
         *  events related to the services of interest. Upon registering with
         *  the event mechanism, a data structure (of type EventReg)
         *  containing information about that registration is placed in a
         *  Map for later processing when events do arrive. If the timing is
         *  right, it is possible that a service event may arrive between the
         *  time the registration is made and the time the EventReg is stored
         *  in the map. Thus, this method may find that the eventRegMap does
         *  not contain an element corresponding to the event this method is
         *  currently processing. In that case, this method will do nothing.
         *  It will simply return so that the service referenced in the event
         *  can be discovered using the snapshot returned by the LookupTask
         *  that is ultimately queued by the RegisterListenerTask (whose
         *  listener registration caused this method to be invoked in the
         *  first place).

         *   - when a new lookup service is discovered, this method will
         *     be called for each previously discovered service
         *   - when a gap in the events from a previously discovered lookup
         *     service is discovered, this method will be called for each
         *     previously discovered service
         *   - when a MATCH_MATCH event is received, this method will
         *     be called for each previously discovered service
         *   - when a NOMATCH_MATCH event is received, this method will
         *     be called for each previously discovered service
         * Note that this method is never called when a MATCH_NOMATCH event
         * is received; such an event is always handled in NotifyEventTask.
         *
         * When this method is called, it may send one of the following events
         * or combination of events:
         *  - a service changed event
         *  - a service removed event followed by a service added event
         *  - a service removed event
         *
         * A service removed event is sent when the service either fails the
         * filter, or the filter produces an indefinite result; in which
         * case, the service is also discarded.
         *
         * A service changed event is sent when the service passes the filter,
         * and it is determined that the service's attributes have changed.
         * In this case, the old and new service proxies are treated as the
         * same if one of the following conditions is met:
         *  - this method was called because of the receipt of a
         *    MATCH_MATCH event
         *  - the old and new service proxies are byte-wise fully equal
         * (Note that the lookup service specification guarantees that the
         * proxies are the same when a MATCH_MATCH event is received.)
         *
         * A service removed event followed by a service added event is sent
         * when the service passes the filter, and the conditions for which
         * a service changed event would be considered are not met; that is,
         * this method was not called because of the receipt of a MATCH_MATCH
         * event; or the old and new service proxies are not byte-wise fully
         * equal.
         *
         *  The if-else-block contained in this method implements the logic
         *  just described. The parameter matchMatchEvent reflects the
         *  pertinent event state that causes this method to be called.
         *  That is, either a MATCH_MATCH event was received, or it wasn't,
         *  (and if it wasn't, then a full byte-wise comparison is performed
         *  to determine whether the proxies are still the same).
         *
         *  To understand when the 'else' part of the if-else-block is
         *  executed, consider the following conditions:
         *   - there is more than one lookup service with which the service
         *     registers (ex. LUS-0 and LUS-1)
         *   - after the service registers with LUS-0, a NOMATCH_MATCH

    /**
     * Constructs an instance of <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> which
     * will, on behalf of the entity that constructs this class, discover and
     * manage a set of lookup services, as well as discover and manage sets
     * of services registered with those lookup services. The entity indicates
     * which lookup services to discover and manage through the parameters
     * input to this constructor.
     * <p>
     * As stated in the class description, this class has three usage patterns:
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li> the entity uses a {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache
     *        LookupCache} to locally store and manage discovered services
     *        so that those services can be accessed quickly
     *   <li> the entity registers with the event mechanism provided by a
     *        {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache} to be notified
     *        when services of interest are discovered
     *   <li> the entity uses the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> to
     *        perform remote queries of the lookup services, employing richer
     *        semantics than that provided through the standard
     *        {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar}
     *        interface
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Although the first two usage patterns emphasize the use of a cache
     * object, that cache is acquired only through an instance of the
     * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class.
     * <p>
     * It is important to note that some of the methods of this class
     * ({@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#createLookupCache
     * createLookupCache} and the <i>blocking</i> versions of
     * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#lookup lookup} to
     * be exact) can throw a {@link java.rmi.RemoteException} when invoked.
     * This is because each of these methods may attempt to register with
     * the event mechanism of at least one lookup service, a process that
     * requires a remote object (a listener) to be exported to the lookup
     * service(s). Both the process of registering with a lookup service's
     * event mechanism and the process of exporting a remote object are
     * processes that can result in a {@link java.rmi.RemoteException}.
     * <p>
     * In order to facilitate the exportation of the remote listener
     * just described, the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class
     * instantiates an inner class that implements the
     * {@link net.jini.core.event.RemoteEventListener RemoteEventListener}
     * interface. Although this class defines, instantiates, and exports this
     * remote listener, <i>it is the entity's responsibility</i> to provide a
     * mechanism for any lookup service to acquire the proxy to the exported
     * listener. One way to do this is to configure this utility to export
     * the listener using the Jini(TM) Extensible Remote Invocation (Jini ERI)
     * communication framework. When the listener is exported to use Jini ERI,
     * and no proxy customizations (such as a custom invocation handler or
     * transport endpoint) are used, no other action is necessary to make the
     * proxy to the listener available to the lookup service(s) with which
     * that listener is registered.
     * <p>
     * The <a href="#eventListenerExporter">default exporter</a> for this
     * utility will export the remote event listener under Jini ERI,
     * specifying that the port and object ID with which the listener is
     * to be exported should be chosen by the Jini ERI framework, not the
     * deployer.
     * <p>
     * If it is required that the remote event listener be exported under
     * JRMP instead of Jini ERI, then the entity that employs this utility
     * must specify this in its configuration. For example, the entity's
     * configuration would need to contain something like the following:
     * <p>
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * import net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter;
     *
     * application.configuration.component.name {
     *    .......
     *    .......
     *    // configuration items specific to the application
     *    .......
     *    .......
     * }//end application.configuration.component.name
     *
     * net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager {
     *
     *    serverExporter = new JrmpExporter();
     *
     * }//end net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager
     * </pre>
     * </blockquote>
     * <p>
     * It is important to note that when the remote event listener is exported
     * under JRMP, unlike Jini ERI, the JRMP remote communication framework
     * does <b><i>not</i></b> provide a mechanism that automatically makes
     * the listener proxy available to the lookup service(s) with which the
     * listener is registered; the deployer of the entity, or the entity
     * itself, must provide such a mechanism.
     * <p>
     * When exported under JRMP, one of the more common mechanisms for making
     * the listener proxy available to the lookup service(s) with which the
     * listener is registered consists of the following:
     * <p>
     * <ul><li> store the necessary class files in a JAR file
     *     <li> make the class files in the JAR file <i>preferred</i>
     *          (see {@link net.jini.loader.pref} for details)
     *     <li> run an HTTP server to serve up the JAR file to any requesting
     *          lookup service
     *     <li> advertise the location of that JAR file by setting the
     *          <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property of the entity
     *          to "point" at the JAR file
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * For example, suppose an application consists of an entity that intends
     * to use the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> will run on a host named
     * <b><i>myHost</i></b>. And suppose that the <i>down-loadable</i> JAR
     * file named <b><i>sdm-dl.jar</i></b> that is provided in the
     * distribution is located in the directory <b><i>/files/jini/lib</i></b>,
     * and will be served by an HTTP server listening on port
     * <b><i>8082</i></b>. If the application is run with its codebase
     * property set to
     * <code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase="http://myHost:8082/sdm-dl.jar"</code>,
     * the lookup service(s) should then be able to access the remote listener
     * exported under JRMP by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> on
     * behalf of the entity.
     * <p>
     * If a mechanism for lookup services to access the remote listener
     * exported by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> is not provided
     * (either by the remote communication framework itself, or by some other
     * means), the remote methods of the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>
     * - the methods involved in the two most important usage patterns of
     * that utility - will be of no use.
     * <p>

     * a common usage scenario that can cause confusion when this version
     * of <code>lookup</code> is used but fails to discover any instances
     * of the expected service of interest. Suppose an entity creates a
     * service discovery manager and then immediately calls this version
     * of <code>lookup</code>, which simply queries the currently discovered
     * lookup services for the service of interest. If the discovery manager
     * employed by the service discovery manager has not yet disovered any
     * lookup services (thus, there are no lookup services to query) the
     * method will immediately return an empty array. This can be confusing
     * when one verifies that instance(s) of such a service of interest
     * have indeed been started and registered with the existing lookup
     * service(s). To address this issue, one of the blocking versions
     * of <code>lookup</code> could be used instead of this version, or
     * the entity could simply wait until the discovery manager has been
     * given enough time to complete its own (lookup) discovery processing.

    /**
     * Queries each available lookup service in the managed set for service(s)
     * that match the input criteria. The semantics of this method are
     * similar to the semantics of the <code>lookup</code> method provided by
     * the <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> interface; employing the same
     * template-matching scheme. Additionally, this method allows any entity
     * to supply an object referred to as a <i>filter</i>. Such an object is
     * a non-remote object that defines additional matching criteria that the
     * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> applies when searching for the
     * entity's services of interest. This filtering facility is particularly
     * useful to entities that wish to extend the capabilities of standard
     * template-matching.
     * <p>
     * This version of <code>lookup</code> returns an <i>array</i> of instances
     * of <code>ServiceItem</code> in which each element corresponds to a
     * service reference that satisfies the matching criteria. The number
     * of elements in the returned set will be no greater than the value of
     * the <code>maxMatches</code> parameter, but may be less.
     * <p>
     * Note that this version of <code>lookup</code> provides a
     * <i>blocking</i> feature that is controlled through the
     * <code>waitDur</code> parameter in conjunction with the
     * <code>minMatches</code> and the <code>maxMatches</code> parameters.
     * This method will not return until one of the following occurs:
     * <p>
     *  <ul>
     *    <li> the number of matching services found on the first attempt is
     *         greater than or equal to the value of the
     *         <code>minMatches</code> parameter, in which case this method
     *         returns each of the services found up to the value of
     *         the <code>maxMatches</code> parameter
     *    <li> the number of matching services found <i>after</i> the first
     *         attempt (that is, after the method enters the "wait state")
     *         is at least as great as the value of the
     *         <code>minMatches</code> parameter in which case this method
     *         returns each of the services found up to the value of
     *         the <code>maxMatches</code> parameter
     *    <li> the amount of time that has passed since this method entered
     *         the wait state exceeds the value of the <code>waitDur</code>
     *         parameter, in which case this method returns all of the
     *         currently discovered services
     *  </ul>
     * <p>
     * The purpose of the <code>minMatches</code> parameter is to allow the
     * entity to balance its need for multiple matching service references
     * with its need to minimize the time spent in the wait state; time that
     * most would consider wasted if an acceptable number of matching service
     * references were found, but this method continued to wait until the end
     * of the designated time period.
     * <p>
     * If, while waiting for the minimum number of desired services to
     * be discovered, the entity decides that it no longer wishes to wait the
     * entire period for this method to return, the entity may interrupt this
     * method by invoking the interrupt method from the <code>Thread</code>
     * class. The intent of this mechanism is to allow the entity to interrupt
     * this method in the same way it would a sleeping thread.
     * <p>
     * Entities typically employ this method when they need infrequent access
     * to multiple instances of services, are willing (or forced) to
     * wait for those services to be found, and consider the cost of making
     * remote queries for those services is outweighed by the overhead
     * of maintaining a local cache (for example, because of resource
     * limitations).
     *
     * @param tmpl        an instance of <code>ServiceTemplate</code>
     *                    corresponding to the object to use for
     *                    template-matching when searching for desired
     *                    services. If <code>null</code> is input to this
     *                    parameter, this method will use a
     *                    <i>wildcarded</i> template  (will match all
     *                    services) when performing template-matching. Note
     *                    that the effects of modifying contents of this
     *                    parameter before this method returns are
     *                    unpredictable and undefined.
     * @param minMatches  this method will immediately exit the wait state
     *                    and return once this number of service references
     *                    is found

     *                    containing matching criteria that should be applied

     *                    searching for desired services. If <code>null</code>
     *                    is input to this parameter, then only

     *                    desired services.
     * @param waitDur     the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     *                    ending the "search" and returning an empty array.
     *                    If a non-positive value is input to this parameter,
     *                    then this method will not wait; it will simply query
     *                    the available lookup services and return whatever
     *                    matching service reference(s) it could find, up
