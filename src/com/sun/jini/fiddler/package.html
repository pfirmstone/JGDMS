<body bgcolor="white">

Provides the server side of an implementation of the lookup discovery service
(see <code>{@link net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryService}</code>). 
Multiple client-side proxy classes are used to interact and communicate 
with the backend server defined in the class 
<code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerImpl}</code>. 
Those proxy classes are:
<ul><li> <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerProxy}</code> - the proxy
         for the <code>{@link net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryService}</code>
         interface, which defines how clients register with the lookup discovery
         service
    <li> <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerAdminProxy}</code> - the proxy
         for the <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerAdmin}</code> interface, 
         which specifies the methods through which clients can perform administrative
         duties such as joining, changing the policy for persisting the service's
         state, and gracefully shutting down the service
    <li> <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerRegistration}</code> - the proxy 
         for the <code>{@link net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryRegistration}</code> 
         interface, which specifies the methods through which clients can perform
         duties such as group and locator management, state retrieval, and discarding 
         discovered but unavailable lookup services so they will be eligible for 
         re-discovery
</ul>
<p>
Clients interact with the <i>Fiddler</i> implementation of the lookup
discovery service by communicating with the backend server through the 
above proxies. When a client makes a remote method invocation on one of 
the proxies, the proxy makes a call on the corresponding method which is 
specified in the <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.Fiddler}</code> interface, 
is implemented in <code>{@link com.sun.jini.fiddler.FiddlerImpl}</code>, 
and ultimately executes on the backend server.
<p>
The Fiddler implementation of the lookup discovery service can be run
in one of the following modes:
<ul><li> <i>transient</i> - when run in this mode, Fiddler will not persist its
         state, and it is not <i>activatable</i>; that is, it will not be 
         restarted by the activation system upon a system crash or failure.
         To run Fiddler in this mode, specify the wrapper class 
         <code>com.sun.jini.fiddler.TransientFiddlerImpl</code>, to the
         {@link com.sun.jini.start.NonActivatableServiceDescriptor}, as
         required by the {@link com.sun.jini.start Service Starter} framework.
    <li> <i>nonactivatable</i> - when run in this mode, Fiddler <i>does</i> persist
         its state, but is not activatable. To run Fiddler in this mode, specify the
         wrapper class <code>com.sun.jini.fiddler.NonActivatableFiddlerImpl</code>,
         to the {@link com.sun.jini.start.NonActivatableServiceDescriptor}, as
         required by the {@link com.sun.jini.start Service Starter} framework.
    <li> <i>activatable</i> - when run in this mode, Fiddler both persists its 
         state, and is activatable. To run Fiddler in this mode, specify the
         wrapper class <code>com.sun.jini.fiddler.ActivatableFiddlerImpl</code>,
         to the {@link com.sun.jini.start.SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor}, as
         required by the {@link com.sun.jini.start Service Starter} framework.

<H2>Configuring Fiddler</H2>

The Fiddler implementation of the lookup discovery service supports the
configuration entries described below; where each configuration entry name
is associated with the component name <code>com.sun.jini.fiddler</code>.
Note that the configuration entries specified here are specific to the
Fiddler implementation of the service. Also note that each entry whose name 
is prefixed with the string "initial" is retrieved only when the service
is started for the first time. All other entries, unless otherwise stated,
are retrieved from the configuration when the service is started
or restarted.

<H2>Loggers Employed By Fiddler</H2>

This implementation of the lookup discovery service (Fiddler) uses a separate
<code>{@link java.util.logging.Logger}</code> for each type of information 
it logs. The name of each <code>Logger</code> is a dot-separated concatenation
of the implementation package name, <code>com.sun.jini.fiddler</code>, with 
a descriptive string. The list below identifies the descriptive part of 
each <code>Logger</code> name, along with a brief description of the 
information that will be sent to the associated Logger.

<a name="fiddlerExamples">
<h2>Examples for Running Fiddler</h2>
</a>

This section provides example command lines, configuration files, and
security policy files for running Fiddler in several configurations.
These examples make the following assumptions:

<ul> <li> The examples are being run on UNIX platforms.
     <li> The Java(TM) 2 Platform, Standard Edition, has been installed
          in the directory <b><i>java_install_dir</i></b>
     <li> The Apache River release has been
          installed in the directory <b><i>jini_install_dir</i></b>
     <li> The example configuration and policy files described below are
          available in the directories <b><i>example_install_dir/config</i></b>
          and <b><i>example_install_dir/policy</i></b> respectively
     <li> The name of the host on which the service will run is <b><i>myHost</i></b>
     <li> The name of the lookup group the service will discover and join 
          is <b><i>myGroup.myCompany.com</i></b>
     <li> The HTTP server for download JAR files will listen for requests
          on port <b><i>8080</i></b>
</ul>
<p>
To use these examples to start Fiddler on your system, you will need to
make one or more modifications that are specific to your system. The list
below describes the sort of modifications you may need to make in order
for the examples to run on your system. 

<ul> <li> Change all occurrences of <b><i>myHost</i></b> to the
          actual name of the host on which the service is to run.
     <li> Replace all occurrences of <b><i>java_install_dir</i></b>
          with the path to the 1.4 version (or above) of the Java 2 
          Platform installed on your system.
     <li> Replace all occurrences of <b><i>jini_install_dir</i></b>
          with the path to the desired version of the Apache River release.
     <li> Replace all occurrences of <b><i>example_install_dir/config</i></b>
          and <b><i>example_install_dir/policy</i></b> with the appropriate
          path to the example configuration and policy files.
     <li> With respect to the <i>command lines</i> provided below, 
          if running on Windows, replace the UNIX file system separator
          <b>'/'</b> with the Windows separator (<b>'\'</b>),
          prepend the appropriate drive-letter-with-colon on all directory path
          file specifications, and replace the various install directories if
          appropriate.
     <li> With respect to the configuration and policy files, if running
          on Windows, prepend the appropriate drive-letter-with-colon on 
          all directory path file specifications, and replace install
          directories where appropriate.
</ul>
<p>
Note that when running on Windows, unlike the command lines, it is 
<i><b>not</b></i> necessary to replace the UNIX file system separator 
with the Windows separator in the example configuration and policy files
provided here. This is because those files specify directory paths using 
the special token for the <code>file.separator</code> system property 
(<b>'${/}'</b>); which provides for the automatic substitution of the 
appropriate separator, depending on the OS.
<p>
<a name="httpServer">
<h3>HTTP Server</h3>

For each of the possible modes in which Fiddler executes, an HTTP server
must be running that makes available the necessary download JAR files from
the <b><i>jini_install_dir/lib-dl</i></b> directory. Note that <b><i>the same 
HTTP server can be used for all of the examples</i></b> described below. 
That is, once started, the HTTP server does <b><i>not</i></b> need to be 
stopped and restarted for each mode in which the service runs.
<p>
If you choose to use the HTTP server supplied with the Apache River
release, then the following command will start that daemon in <i>verbose</i>
mode, listening for requests on port <code>8080</code>, and serving files 
from the root directory, <b><i>jini_install_dir/lib-dl</i></b>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java_install_dir/bin/java -jar jini_install_dir/lib/classserver.jar \
                               -dir jini_install_dir/lib-dl \
                               -port 8080 \
                               -verbose
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that rather than executing the HTTP server directly as shown above,
it can also be run as a transient service using the
{@link com.sun.jini.start Service Starter} framework. For details on
how to do this, refer to the 
<a href="../../../../com/sun/jini/tool/ClassServer.html" 
title="class in com.sun.jini.tool"><code>ClassServer</code></a>
documentation.
<p>
<a name="executionModes">
<h3>The Execution Modes of the Service</h3>

As stated above, Fiddler can be run in one of the following three modes:
<ul><li>transient (not persistent and not activatable)
    <li>nonactivatable (persistent but not activatable)
    <li>activatable (persistent and activatable)
</ul>
<p>
One of the significant features of Jini Network Technology is that it is 
designed to allow for configuration and pluggability of the remote communication
framework itself, as well as the transport employed by that framework.
Because of this, the list of framework/transport combinations that Fiddler 
can be configured to use for its remote communication, in conjunction with
the mode in which Fiddler is configured to run, is essentially
boundless. The flexibility inherent in the configuration mechanism allows 
Fiddler not only to be configured to employ any <i>existing</i> remote 
communication framework and transport, but also any <i>future</i> framework 
or transport that may be defined. The current release of Apache River
provides implementations for the following remote communication frameworks 
and transports:
<ul><li>JRMP over TCP/IP
    <li>Jini Extensible Remote Invocation (<i>Jini ERI</i>) over TCP/IP (the default for all modes)
    <li>Jini ERI over HTTP
    <li>Jini ERI over HTTPS
    <li>Jini ERI over SSL/TLS (JSSE)
    <li>Jini ERI over Kerberos/GSS-API (JGSS)
</ul>
<p>
So as not to exceed the scope of this document, the examples below
are limited to the following combinations of mode and remote
communication mechanism:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#transientJRMP"><code>transient mode using JRMP over TCP/IP</code></a>
  <li> <a href="#transientJERI"><code>transient mode using Jini ERI over TCP/IP</code></a>
  <li> <a href="#nonactivatableJERI"><code>nonactivatable mode using Jini ERI over TCP/IP</code></a>
  <li> <a href="#activatableJRMP"><code>activatable mode using JRMP over TCP/IP</code></a>
  <li> <a href="#activatableJERI"><code>activatable mode using Jini ERI over TCP/IP</code></a>
</ul>
For detailed examples of the other combinations, see the

<h3>Activation</h3>
In order to run the activatable mode of this service, an activation
system must be running on the same host as the service. For previous
releases, RMID was used for this purpose. Although RMID 
may still be used under certain circumstances, it is recommended that the 
<a href="../../../../com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html"><code>com.sun.jini.phoenix</code></a>
implementation supplied with the Apache River release now be used for all 
activatable configurations of the service.
<p>
For the two activatable examples below, command lines for starting
and stopping Phoenix, along with an associated set of example configuration 
and policy files are presented. Note that, as with the HTTP server, Phoenix 
may also be started using the {@link com.sun.jini.start Service Starter} 
framework (as described 
<a href="../../../../com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html"><code>here</code></a>).
<p>
<h3>Configuration and Security Policy Files</h3>
In each of the examples below, the service requires a configuration file
and a security policy file. Additionally, because the Service Starter 
framework is used to start the service, a separate configuration and
policy file - different than that provided for the service - are provided 
for that framework. Finally, for the activatable mode of the service, not 
only are configuration files and a security policy file required to run 
Phoenix, but because the Service Starter framework executes the service in 
an <code>{@link java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroup ActivationGroup}</code>
(referred to as a <i>shared VM</i>) that may be shared with other services,
a configuration and policy file are both required to be defined for the 
shared VM as well.
<p>
The table below shows what is required for each example configuration of 
Fiddler presented here:

<a name="jeriTransientFiddlerConfig">
<h4>Service Configuration: example_install_dir/config/jeri-transient-fiddler.config</h4>
Note that the value of the <a href="#serverExporter"><code>serverExporter</code></a>
configuration entry specified in this example configuration file is actually the default 
value that would be used by the service if no value were supplied for that entry. 
Although it is not necessary to specify a value for that entry, it is included in this 
example for reference purposes. Note also that when the value of the <code>port</code> 
argument in the call to <code>TcpServerEndpoint.getInstance</code> is 0 (as it is in 
this example), the actual port used to export the service will be randomly chosen by 
the Jini ERI framework.
<p>
It may be worth comparing the exporter specified in this example to the exporter 
specified in the <a href="#jeriNonactivatableFiddlerConfig"><code>JERI/Nonactivatable</code></a> 
example presented later. This example allows the Jini ERI <i>framework</i> - not the 
deployer - to choose the port and object ID with which to export the service, whereas the 
<a href="#jeriNonactivatableFiddlerConfig"><code>JERI/Nonactivatable</code></a> example 
specifies a <i>specific</i> port and object ID to use. This can be seen by observing 
that this example inputs 0 for the port and uses only the 4-argument version of the
<code>{@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter BasicJeriExporter}</code> constructor 
(leaving the object ID unspecified), whereas the other example configures the exporter 
using the 5-argument version of the constructor, supplying a non-zero value for the port 
and a specific value for the object ID in the last argument.
<p>
To understand why the transient and nonactivatable modes of the service are exported 
differently, consider the following. The nonactivatable mode of the service persists 
its state because it wishes to be able to recover and pick up where it left off when 
it is restarted after a crash or system failure. As will be explained in a little more 
detail <a href="#nonactivatableJRMP"><code>below</code></a>, in order to do this, the 
service must always be exported and re-exported using the same port and object ID.
Thus, for the nonactivatable mode of the service under Jini ERI, the exporter used is 
configured with a fixed port and object ID. On the other hand, there is no such 
requirement for the transient modes of the service (under either JRMP or Jini ERI). 
This is because by its nature, each time a transient service is started, it is as if 
it is started for the very first time; there is no state to recover, no "place" to 
pick up where a previous run left off.

<!-- Nonactivatable-JRMP -->

<a name="nonactivatableJRMP">
<h3>Nonactivatable Mode using JRMP</h3>

Although it is possible to run Fiddler in nonactivatable mode using JRMP, it is
not recommended. This is because when Fiddler has been configured in this way 
and is restarted, clients of the service that hold old proxies to the service
that were created on a previous run will not be able to interact with the
service through those old proxies; effectively making the restarted service
useless to those clients.  A proxy that was created on a previous run cannot
be used to communicate with the restarted service because such a proxy
is associated with an old object ID, produced when the service was previously
exported; whereas the restarted service will be associated with a <b><i>new</i></b>, 
different object ID, produced when the service is re-exported during the restart. 
Note that this will be true even if the service is re-exported on the same port. 
<p>
The reason the restarted service cannot be re-exported with the object ID from 
its previous run is that when a service is configured to use JRMP, the service 
is exported using a {@link net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter}, and such an exporter 
cannot be created with a pre-specified object ID. Thus, although the old 
object ID could be recovered from persisted state when the service is restarted, 
there is no way to re-export the service (under JRMP) with that old object ID. 
And so a new object ID is assigned to the service's inner proxy every time the 
service is restarted. To address this, one might argue that clients could always 
obtain a new service proxy (containing the new inner proxy with the new object ID) 
simply by re-querying the lookup service. But this only addresses <i>primary</i>
proxies to the service; it doesn't address <i>secondary</i> proxies such as
leases the service had issued to its clients on previous runs. Any such leases
would no longer be valid, and so each client would need to re-register with the 
restarted service through the new primary proxy to obtain new leases. From the 
point of view of the client then, it would be as if the service was started anew.
<p>
Note that for nonactivatable, persistent services that are exported using 
Jini ERI, the above situation can be avoided. Jini ERI allows the service
to be configured to always be exported on the same port, with the same object ID 
(see the <a href="#jeriNonactivatableFiddlerConfig"><code>JERI/Nonactivatable</code></a> 
example configuration below). Thus, any primary or secondary proxies a client 
holds that are from a prior run of the service, can still be used to communicate 
with the service when the service is restarted. 
<p>
Also note that the situation described above for nonactivatable, persistent
services exported under JRMP does not affect services that are registered with 
an activation system (that is, services that are <i>activatable</i>); and this
holds for services exported under <i>either</i> JRMP or Jini ERI. This is
because the activation mechanism provided in Java Remote Method Invocation 
(<i>Java RMI</i>) provides for <i>persistent references</i>; that is,
remote references that remain valid after the service has crashed and been
restarted. For more details, see the <a href="../../../../../release-notes/activation.html" 
title="Note on RMI Activation and How it is Used in the Apache River release">
<code>"Note on RMI Activation"</code></a>.
<p>
Finally, recall that a primary purpose for persisting state is so that the service 
can recover that state and pick up where it left off when restarted. For the
reasons described above, when a service is configured to be persistent but 
nonactivatable, and is also configured to be exported using JRMP, that purpose 
cannot be achieved. Therefore, the use of such a configuration is strongly 
discouraged. With this in mind, the following guidelines should be considered 
when deciding how to configure a service with respect to mode, communication 
framework, and transport:
<ul><li>If state recovery is not important, then the service should be configured 
        for the transient mode using the communication framework and 
        transport of choice.
    <li>If state recovery is important, but JRMP is not necessary, then the 
        service should be configured for the mode of choice, but the 
        communication framework should be Jini ERI with the transport of
        choice.
    <li>If both state recovery and JRMP are necessary, then the service 
        should be configured to be activatable. That is, the only way to get 
        persistent, valid JRMP references is when the service is activatable.
</ul>

<h3>Nonactivatable Mode using Jini ERI</h3>

The following command will start Fiddler in <b><i>nonactivatable</i></b> mode

system upon a system crash or failure. In order to recover its state and "pick

<!-- Phoenix-JRMP -->

<a name="phoenixJRMP">
<h3>Phoenix using JRMP</h3>

In order to run Fiddler in any of the activatable configurations, an
activation system must be running on the same host as Fiddler. Phoenix
is the name of the implementation of the activation system provided with 
the Apache River release. Because Phoenix is configurable and supports the desired 
communication mechanisms, that implementation is presented with the
activatable configurations of Fiddler that follow. (For more information
and examples on Phoenix, refer to the Phoenix documentation 
<a href="../../../../com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html"><code>here</code></a>.)
<p>
The following commands will, respectively, start and stop Phoenix when using 
<b><i>JRMP</i></b> for remote communication.

<!-- Activatable-JRMP -->

<a name="activatableJRMP">
<h3>Activatable Mode using JRMP</h3>

The first command shown below will start Fiddler in <b><i>activatable</i></b> mode 
using <b><i>JRMP</i></b> for remote communication. This configuration of Fiddler will 
persist its state information, and it will be restarted by the activation system 
upon a system crash or failure.
<p>
The second command will destroy the shared VM in which Fiddler (and possibly other
services) are running. That command will remove the shared VM log directories, but
will not remove any service-specific persistence directories. Typically, this
command is executed only after all services executing in the shared VM have
been gracefully (administratively) shutdown.

<!-- Activatable-JERI -->

<a name="activatableJERI">
<h3>Activatable Mode using Jini ERI</h3>

The first command shown below will start Fiddler in <b><i>activatable</i></b> mode 
using <b><i>Jini ERI</i></b> for remote communication. This configuration of Fiddler
will persist its state information, and it will be restarted by the activation system 
upon a system crash or failure.
<p>
The second command will destroy the shared VM in which Fiddler (and possibly other
services) are running. That command will remove the shared VM log directories, but
will not remove any service-specific persistence directories. Typically, this
command is executed only after all services executing in the shared VM have
been gracefully (administratively) shutdown.
