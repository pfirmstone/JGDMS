/**
 * A Queue of timed tasks.  Each task implements {@link Runnable}.
 * Events can either be executed in the queue's thread or in their own thread.
 * <p>
 * A task is an object that implements <code>Runnable</code>.  It is
 * scheduled by invoking {@link #schedule(long, Runnable, WakeupManager.ThreadDesc)
 * schedule} with a time at which it should be run.  When that time
 * arrives (approximately) the task will be pulled off the queue and
 * have its {@link Runnable#run run} method invoked.  <p>
 *
 * A <code>schedule</code> request can specify a
 * {@link WakeupManager.ThreadDesc}, which will define the parameters
 * of a thread to be created to run the <code>Runnable</code>.  You can
 * specify the group, whether the thread is a daemon thread, and the priority.
 * Additionally you can use a subclass of <code>WakeupManager.ThreadDesc</code>
 * and override the {@link WakeupManager.ThreadDesc#thread thread} method
 * to further customize thread creation.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When a task is scheduled, a {@link WakeupManager.Ticket} is returned
 * that can be used to cancel the event if desired.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The queue requires its own thread, whose parameters can be defined
 * via a <code>ThreadDesc</code> if desired. The queue's thread
 * will be started when the first task is scheduled. If the queue
 * becomes empty the thread will be terminated after a 
 * <a href=#queueThreadTimeout>configurable delay</a>. The thread
 * will be re-started if a new task is scheduled.
 * <p>
 *
 * While it is theoretically possible to obtain the queue's thread and
 * interrupt it, the results of doing so are undefined. If a client
 * wishes to stop the queue's thread the client should either remove
 * all the tasks or call {@link #stop}. Note, calling
 * <code>stop</code> will cause future <code>schedule</code> calls to
 * fail with an <code>IllegalStateException</code>. <p>
