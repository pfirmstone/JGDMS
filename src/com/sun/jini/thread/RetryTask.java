/**
 * An abstract class for building tasks that retry on failure after a
 * timeout period.  This builds upon <code>TaskManager</code> for task
 * execution and <code>WakeupManager</code> for retry scheduling.  You
 * extend <code>RetryTask</code>, implementing <code>tryOnce</code> to
 * represent a single attempt at the task.  If <code>tryOnce</code>
 * returns <code>true</code>, the attempt was successful and the task
 * is complete.  If <code>tryOnce</code> returns <code>false</code>,
 * the task is scheduled for a future retry using <code>WakeupManager</code>.
 * <p>
 * The default retry times are defined by this class's implementation
 * of <code>retryTime</code></code>.  You can override this method to
 * change the retry times.
 * <p>
 * It is legal to reuse the same task again and again, but only after
 * the task is complete and <code>reset</code> has been called.
 * Inserting the same task multiple times before it has either been
 * cancelled or completed successfully will generate unpredictable
 * behavior.<p>
 *
 * This class uses the {@link Logger} named
 * <code>com.sun.jini.thread.RetryTask</code> to log information at
 * the following logging levels: <p>
 *
 * <table border=1 cellpadding=5
 *       summary="Describes logging performed by RetryTask at different
 *	          logging levels">
 *
 * <tr> <th> Level <th> Description
 *
 * <tr> <td> FINEST <td> after a failed attempt, when should 
 *                       the task be scheduled for a re-try
 *
 * </table>
