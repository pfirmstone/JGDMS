Provides an implementation of the <code>net.jini.discovery.ssl</code> discovery
format, specified in the <i>Jini Discovery and Join Specification</i>.  The
{@link com.sun.jini.discovery.ssl.Client} class implements the client side of
the <code>net.jini.discovery.ssl</code> discovery format for the unicast
discovery protocol, while the {@link com.sun.jini.discovery.ssl.Server} class
implements the server side of the discovery format for that protocol.  Both
classes are intended to be specified in a resource to configure the operation
of the {@link com.sun.jini.discovery.Discovery} class, as described in the
documentation for
{@link com.sun.jini.discovery.Discovery#getProtocol2(ClassLoader)}.

<h2>Supported Constraints</h2>

This provider supports the same constraints as the Jini extensible remote
invocation (Jini ERI) SSL transport provider; these constraints are listed in
the documentation for the {@link net.jini.jeri.ssl} package.

<h2>System Properties</h2>

This provider can be configured using the same system properties as those
consulted by the SSL transport provider, also listed in the documentation for
the {@link net.jini.jeri.ssl} package.

@since 2.0
