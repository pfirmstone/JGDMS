  <dt> <b>Configuration</b></dt>
  <dd> The following configuration entries have been added to the
       Mahalo implementation:
       <UL>
       <LI> <B>settlerPool</B> -  The pool of threads used to settle outstanding
            transactions.
       <LI> <B>taskPool</B> -  The pool of threads used to settle transactions.
       </UL>
       These "thread pool" objects can now be sized for end user
       applications. See Mahalo's package
       <a href="../api/com/sun/jini/mahalo/package-summary.html#configuration">documentation</a>
       for more detail.
  </dd>
  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b></dt>
  <dd> The following bugs have been addressed in this release:
  <p>
  <dl>
  <dt><b>
      4285733: Is the Transaction spec correct about permissible votes?
      </b></dt>
  <dd>Section TX.2.7 of the
      Jini (TM) Transaction Specification was changed to correct the permissible     
      vote outcomes for <code>prepare</code>. Specifically, the
      <code>COMMITTED</code> vote was changed to <code>PREPARED</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>
      4394196: Txn specs fixes
      </b></dt>
  <dd>Section TX.1.3 of the
      Jini (TM) Transaction Specification was changed to emphasize that Java(TM)      
      Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) semantics are replied upon and not any particular
      implementation. Section TX.2.3 removed a confusing "crash count" example.
      In section TX.2.7, the paragraphs dealing with <code>abort</code>
      and <code>prepareAndCommit</code> were modified for clarity. Section 2.8
      was modified to note that the commit point record can be removed after
      successfully returning from <code>abort</code>
      (in addition to <code>commit</code>). Section 2.8.1 added an additional
      bullet item noting that <code>getState</code> can return
      <code>ABORTED</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>
      4761012: prepareAndCommit semantics amibiguous wrt idempotentcy
      </b></dt>
  <dd>Section TX.2.6 & TX.2.7 of the
      Jini (TM) Transaction Specification were changed to note that
      <code>prepareAndCommit</code> calls may not be idempotent.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>
      5054742: Transaction spec does not specify whether or not participant
      commit is atomic
      </b></dt>
  <dd>Section TX.3.5 of the
      Jini (TM) Transaction Specification was changed to note that
      participants are not required to implement atomic <code>abort</code> and
      <code>commit</code> calls.
  </dd>  </dl>
