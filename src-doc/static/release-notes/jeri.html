<H3>Description</H3>

<p>The <a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.jeri</code></a>
package and its subpackages provide APIs for Jini extensible remote
invocation (Jini ERI) and several Jini ERI transport layer providers.

<H3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</H3>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-22'>RIVER-22</a>] -

</li>

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>



<dt><b>Multihomed host support</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>As recommended by RFC 1123, the transport endpoints now attempt connections
to all the IP addresses that a given host name may resolve to, instead of just
the first one.
</dd>

<dt><b>Trust verification restriction</b>
<dd><p><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html"><code>BasicJeriTrustVerifier</code></a>
has been changed to trust fewer dynamic proxies. In particular, in addition to
implementing
<a href="../api/net/jini/core/constraint/RemoteMethodControl.html"><code>RemoteMethodControl</code></a>,
the dynamic proxy must now implement one or more well-formed remote interfaces
(ones that extend <code>Remote</code> and for which all methods declare
<code>RemoteException</code> or a superclass in their throws clause), and
must not implement any other interfaces except
<a href="../api/net/jini/security/proxytrust/TrustEquivalence.html"><code>TrustEquivalence</code></a>.
</dd>

<dt><b>New <code>BasicJeriTrustVerifier</code> <code>protected</code>
methods</b>

<dd><p><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html"><code>BasicJeriTrustVerifier</code></a>
has five new <code>protected</code> methods to allow for more
convenient implementation of certain behaviors through subclassing:

<ul>

<li><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html#hasTrustedProxyClass(java.lang.Object,%20net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context)"><code>hasTrustedProxyClass</code></a>
can be overridden by subclasses to control which dynamic proxy classes for
Jini ERI proxies are considered locally trusted.

<li><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html#hasTrustedClassLoader(java.lang.Object,%20net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context)"><code>hasTrustedClassLoader</code></a>
can be overridden by subclasses to control the set of class loaders
for which the class of a Jini ERI proxy, when defined by one of those
loaders, is considered locally trusted.

<li><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html#isTrustedProxyInterface(java.lang.Class,%20net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context)"><code>isTrustedProxyInterface</code></a>
can be overridden by subclasses to control which dynamic proxy interfaces for
Jini ERI proxies are considered locally trusted.

<li><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html#isTrustedInvocationHandler(java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler,%20net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context)"><code>isTrustedInvocationHandler</code></a>
can be overridden by subclasses to support verification of invocation
handlers that have a locally trusted class other than <a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicInvocationHandler.html"><code>BasicInvocationHandler</code></a>
(such as a subclass of <code>BasicInvocationHandler</code>).

<li><a
href="../api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriTrustVerifier.html#checkInvocationHandlerContent(net.jini.jeri.BasicInvocationHandler,%20net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context)"><code>checkInvocationHandlerContent</code></a>
can be invoked by subclasses that override
<code>isTrustedInvocationHandler</code> to perform the verification
steps that the default implementation of
<code>isTrustedInvocationHandler</code> would perform, except that the
class of the invocation handler is not required to be
<code>BasicInvocationHandler</code> exactly, so that trusted
subclasses can be supported.
