<title>Jini Join Utilities Release Notes</title>

<center><h1>Jini Join Utilities
  <BR>Apache River v2.2.1 Release Notes
</h1></center>
<HR>
<UL>
<H3>Description</H3>

The class
<a href="../api/net/jini/lookup/JoinManager.html"> <code>net.jini.lookup.JoinManager</code></a>
is a utility class that, along with supporting interfaces and classes, 
encapsulates functionality that can help Jini technology-enabled services 
(<i>Jini services</i>) demonstrate good behavior in their discovery- 
and registration-related interactions with Jini lookup services. 
In particular, this utility performs functions related to lookup 
service discovery and registration (<i>joining</i>), as well as lease
renewal and attribute management.
<p>
The specification for the 
<a href="../api/net/jini/lookup/JoinManager.html"> <code>JoinManager</code></a> 
utility (join manager) is contained in the  <i>Jini Join Utilities Specification</i>,
which is available in <a href="../specs/html/joinutil-spec.html">html</a>.

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Configuration</b>
  <dd> A new configuration entry has been added to the join manager implementation
       in this release: <b>maxLeaseDuration</b>.
       <p>
       This new entry allows one to configure the maximum lease duration
       (in milliseconds) that is requested from each discovered lookup service
       on behalf of the service; both when the lease is initially requested,
       as well as when renewal of that lease is requested. Thus, as this value
       is made smaller, renewal requests will be made more frequently while the
       service is up, and lease expiration will occur sooner when the service
       goes down.
       <p>
       This new configuration entry is a result of <code>RFE 6202650</code>,
       described <a href="#rfe6202650"> below</a>.
       <p>
       A full list of supported configuration entries is given in this utility's
       <a href="../api/net/jini/lookup/JoinManager.html#jmConfigEntries"> class
documentation</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <b>Logging</b>
  <dd> In this release, no changes have occurred with respect to the logging mechanism
       employed by the join manager implementation; which logs diagnostic information to the
       <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html"> <code>Logger</code></a>
       named <code>net.jini.lookup.JoinManager</code>. For a description of the
       information that is logged, as well as the associated logging levels, refer to the
       <a href="../api/net/jini/lookup/JoinManager.html#jmLogging"> class documentation</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <b>New Feature Enhancements</b>
  <dd> In this release, the following feature enhancements have been added to
       the join manager:
  <p>
  <dt><b>4879947: JoinManager should support changing the service proxy</b><dt>
  <dd> The <a href="../api/net/jini/lookup/JoinManager.html"> public API</a> of
the
       join manager has been enhanced with a new method having two versions:

<pre><code>public void replaceRegistration(Object serviceProxy) {...}
public void replaceRegistration(Object serviceProxy, Entry[] attrSets) {...}</code></pre>

       Using either version of this new method, one can register a new
       reference to the service (optionally, with new attributes) which
       was previously registered, by the join manager, with all discovered
       lookup services. Refer to the <a href="../specs/html/joinutil-spec.html"> specification</a>
       of the join manager for details on the semantics of this new method.
       <p>
       All necessary modifications were made to the join manager
       implementation to comply with this change.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>5110241: JoinManager spec change - lease from discarded LUS should be cancelled, not removed (JU.5.1)</b><dt>
  <dd> Section JU.5.1 of the join manager <a href="../specs/html/joinutil-spec.html"> specification</a>
       states that when a lookup service has been discarded, the lease granted
       by that lookup service should be removed -- but not cancelled -- from the       lease renewal manager, and the lease should be allowed to expire.
       That section of the spec was changed to require that the lease
       be ultimately cancelled rather than removed.
       <p>
       All necessary modifications were made to the join manager
       implementation to comply with this change.
  </dd>
  <p>

<a name="rfe6202650">
  <dt><b>6202650: JoinManager should allow configurable control of lease renewal interval</b><dt>
  <dd> When a service employs a join manager to manage the service's
       join state, the join manager registers the service with
       lookup services and then manages the leases associated with each
       registration using a lease renewal manager. The lease renewal manager
       used by the join manager is either created by the
       join manager or supplied by the service itself.
       <p>
       After registering the service with a lookup service, the
       join manager passes the resulting lease to the lease
       renewal manager, requesting that the lease be renewed at regular
       intervals based on the lease duration ultimately granted by the
       lookup service. This means that when the service goes down and
       the lease renewal manager is no longer available to renew the
       service's lease, the lookup service will not notify interested
       parties that the service is down until that lease duration has
       actually passed. Thus, the timeliness of such notifications is
       directly related to the maximum lease duration granted by the
       particular lookup service implementation with which the service
       was registered. If the developer of a system desires more timely
       notification of a service's demise, the developer either has to
       configure/administer the lookup service to grant shorter leases,
       or subclass the lease renewal manager supplied to the
       join manager.
       <p>
       Although the lease renewal manager provides the ability for the
       user of the lease renewal manager to control the lease duration
       requested, and thus the length of the renewal interval, until
       now, the join manager did not provide the service
       with access to this functionality. Over the years, a number of
       users have asked for this capability. This feature enhancement
       is intended to satisfy that request.
       <p>
       All necessary modifications were made to the join manager
       implementation to comply with this change.
  </dd>
  <p>

  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b>
  <dd> A number of bugs have been addressed in this release of the
       join manager. What follows is a description of those bugs that
       might be of interest:
  <p>

  <dt><b>5090332: Specifying WakeupManager in JoinManager configuration causes thread leak</b><dt>
  <dd> Specifying a wakeup manager in the join manager configuration causes
       an extra thread to be created and never destroyed for every new
       join manager that is created.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>5103210: JoinManager has race condition when a LUS is discarded/re-discovered</b><dt>
  <dd> If a previously discovered lookup service is discarded from the discovery       manager being used by the join manager, there is a race condition
       in the join manager that can result in the service not re-registering
       with the lookup service when it is re-discovered. To understand how this
       race can occur, consider the following sequence:
<pre><code>discard lookup service --> DiscMgrListener.discarded()
removeTasks
queue DiscardProxyTask

re-discover lookup service --> DiscMgrListener.discovered()
if(!joinSet.contains(lookup service)) --> add lookup service to joinSet
                                      --> queue RegisterTask
DiscardProxyTask runs
remove lookup service from joinSet
cancel service's lease with the discarded lookup service</code></pre>

       Because <code>DiscMgrListener.discovered()</code> tests <code>joinSet</code> for
       the lookup service before <code>DiscardProxyTask</code> removes that lookup
       service from <code>joinSet</code> (and cancels the service's lease with
       the lookup service), the <code>RegisterTask</code> is not queued and run;       thus, the service is never re-registered with the lookup service.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>6181162: JoinManager should create default LDM only when no DiscoveryManagement is configured</b><dt>
  <dd> Prior to interrogating the configuration for a
       <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/DiscoveryManagement.html"> <code>DiscoveryManagement</code></a>
       item (entry name = <b><i>discoveryManager</i></b>), a default
       <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code></a>
       is first created. Although that manager is initialized to discover no groups and no locators,
       the <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscovery.html"> <code>LookupDiscovery</code></a>
       instance used by the default discovery manager to perform group discovery creates
       a thread to listen for and process multicast announcements, as well as
       additional, related threads. Thus, if a deployer configures a <i>discoveryManagement</i>
       item, the creation of the default lookup discovery manager -- and the threads
       that manager ultimately creates -- is unnecessary, and wastes resources.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.
  </dd>
  <p>
  <dt><b>6215208: JoinManager race - repeated UnknownLeaseException-Reregistration-UnknownLeaseException</b><dt>
  <dd> A race condition was discovered in which an
       <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lease/UnknownLeaseException.html"> <code>UnknownLeaseException</code></a>
       followed by a re-registration can repeatedly occur. This condition is
       intitiated by a discard of the lookup service coincident with a service
       lease expiration.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.
  </dd>
