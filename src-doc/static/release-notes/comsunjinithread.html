Apache River v3.0.0 Release Notes</h1>

<H3>Description</H3>

The <code>org.apache.river.thread</code> package contains various
thread-related utility classes and interfaces. These classes and interfaces
are not intended for general use, but are used internally by other parts of
the Apache River release. Some of these classes
and interfaces are exposed via the configuration mechanism.

<H3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</H3>

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>

A number of improvements have been made to the <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.html">
<code>org.apache.river.thread.WakeupManager</code></a>.
<code>WakeupManager</code> instances are used to schedule tasks that need
to be run in the future. Many of the services and utilities in the starter
kit obtain the required <code>WakeupManager</code> instances from their
configuration. <p>

<dl>

<dt><b>The <code>WakeupManager.ThreadDesc</code> Class Can Now Be More
Usefully Subclassed and Has Been Made More Accessible</b>
<dd>
Instances of the <a href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.ThreadDesc.html"><code>
<code>WakeupManager.ThreadDesc</code></a> class are used by
<code>WakeupManager</code> to create threads. A <code>ThreadDesc</code>
can be specified optionally when a <code>WakeupManager</code> is created,
and/or when a task is scheduled that needs to be run in its own thread.
The <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.ThreadDesc.html#thread(java.lang.Runnable)"><code>
ThreadDesc.thread</code></a> method has been made public, which gives
subclasses of <code>ThreadDesc</code> complete control over how threads are
created and allows subclasses of  <code>WakeupManager</code> to invoke
the <code> ThreadDesc.thread</code> method.
Also, public <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.ThreadDesc.html#getGroup()"><code>getGroup</code></a>,
<a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.ThreadDesc.html#isDaemon()"><code>isDaemon</code></a>,
and <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.ThreadDesc.html#getPriority()"><code>getPriority</code></a>
methods have been added to <code>ThreadDesc</code> and the default
implementation of <code>ThreadDesc.thread</code> has been changed to use
them. This work had been assigned issue numbers 5091282 and 6308590.
<p>

<dt><b>Protected Factory Method for
<code>WakeupManager.Ticket</code>s Has Been Added to <code>WakeupManager</code></b>
<dd>

When a task is added to a <code>WakeupManager</code>, the caller gets a <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.Ticket.html"><code>WakeupManager.Ticket</code></a>
object than can be used to remove the task if necessary.  The protected
method, <a
href="../api/org/apache/river/thread/WakeupManager.html#newTicket"><code>WakeupManager.newTicket</code></a>,
has been added so subclasses of <code>WakeupManager</code> can create
<code>Ticket</code> instances. This work had been assigned issue number
6264220.
<p>


<dt><b><code>WakeupManager</code> Only Keeps Internal Thread Running When
There Are Tasks Pending</b>
<dd>

Previous versions of <code>WakeupManager</code> always had one running
(though often waiting) thread even if there were no pending tasks. This
version of <code>WakeupManager</code> only creates its internal thread when
the first task is enqueued. It will let this thread end, after a
configurable timeout, if there are no tasks pending. This work had been
assigned issue number 6190278.
