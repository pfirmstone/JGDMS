<H3>Description</H3>

&quot;Outrigger&quot; is the name of the contributed JavaSpaces service
from Sun Microsystems.  The primary interface implemented by Outrigger is the
<code><a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html">net.jini.space.JavaSpace05</a></code>
interface (note, <code>JavaSpace05</code> extends the
<code>net.jini.space.JavaSpace</code> interface so any implementation of
<code>JavaSpace05</code> can also be used as a <code>JavaSpace</code>). For
a listing of the additional interfaces implemented by Outrigger, please
consult <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html">Outrigger's
package documentation</a>.

<dt><b>Outrigger Implements the Proposed <code>net.jini.space.JavaSpace05</code>       Extension to JavaSpaces technology</b>
<dd>

This version of Outrigger implements the proposed
<code>net.jini.space.JavaSpace05</code> extension to JavaSpaces
technology. The <code>JavaSpace05</code> interface extends the
<code>JavaSpace</code> interface to provide methods that allow clients to
perform batch operations on the space (which are generally more efficient
than performing an equivalent set of singleton operations) and to more
easily develop applications where a given <code>Entry</code> needs to be
read by multiple clients. See the API documentation for the <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html">JavaSpace05</a></code>
interface for details.<p>
<p>

<dt><b>New <code>Store</code> Implementation, PSEPro Runtime Classes Not
Included in Release</b>
<dd>

The persistent version of Outrigger relies on a pluggable persistence layer,
<a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/Store.html"><code>com.sun.jini.outrigger.Store</code></a>.
Previous releases included one implementation of the <code>Store</code>
interface, <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/logstore/LogStore.html">logstore</a>.
This release adds a second implementation, <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/snaplogstore/LogStore.html">snaplogstore</a>.
<p>

While all the necessary classes are included with this release to run the
transient version of Outrigger, or the persistent version using the new
snaplogstore implementation of <code>Store</code>, the logstore
implementation of <code>Store</code> requires the runtime classes for
Progress Software's <i>ObjectStore PSEPro for Java</i>
(PSEPro). Unfortunately, because of issues relating to the transition in
licensing, this release does not include the PSEPro runtime classes,
without which logstore will not work. We are sorry for any inconvenience
this will cause.  We hope to make a release with a complete version of
logstore available as a separate download in the future.
<p>

Where v2.0.n releases used logstore as the default <code>Store</code>
implementation, this release has no default store. In order to switch an
existing set of configuration files, security policy files, etc., from
using logstore to snaplogstore, you will need to change the <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html#store">
<code>com.sun.jini.outrigger.store</code></a> configuration entry (or add a
<code>store</code> if you don't already have one) to yield a
<code>com.sun.jini.outrigger.snaplogstore.LogStore</code> object. You will
also need to ensure that <code>outrigger-snaplogstore.jar</code> has been
granted sufficient permissions (see Outrigger's package <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html#outrigger_all_policy">documentation</a>
for a sample security policy file.).<p>

Note that depending on the nature of your application snaplogstore can have
a significantly different performance profile than logstore.<p>

The storage formats used by snaplogstore and logstore are mutually
incompatible.<p>
<p>

<dt><b>Incompatible Change Made to <code>Store</code> Interface</b>

<dd>
The persistent version of Outrigger relies on a pluggable persistence
layer, <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/Store.html"><code>com.sun.jini.outrigger.Store</code></a>.
This release makes incompatible changes to a subsidiary interface, <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/LogOps.html"><code>com.sun.jini.outrigger.LogOps</code></a>
in order to support the implementation of the <a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html"><code>JavaSpace05</code></a>
interface. New methods were added and existing methods were changed, so old
implementations will need to be changed to work with the current
release, and any implementation that works with the current release will
need to be changed to work with previous releases.<p>

Note, we consider the <code>Store</code> and its associated subsidiary
interfaces to be experimental. They will often change incompatibly between
releases, and could be removed completely.<p>

<dt><b>Persistent Store Incompatible with Previous Versions</b>
<dd>
As part of implementing <a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html"><code>JavaSpace05</code></a>,
we made incompatible changes to Outrigger's persistent store. The files
generated by previous releases will not be compatible with this release.
<p>

<dt><b>Network Protocol Incompatible with Previous Versions</b>
<dd>
In order to use a more efficient protocol for returning the results of <a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace.html#write(net.jini.core.entry.Entry,
net.jini.core.transaction.Transaction,
long)"><code>JavaSpace.write</code></a> calls, the network protocol used to
communicate between Outrigger's proxy and server was incompatibly
changed. Note, for most installations this should not cause a problem as
clients will transparently download the new version of the proxy that uses
the new protocol.
<p>

<dt><b>The <code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code>,
<code>ConstrainableJavaSpaceAdmin</code>, and <code>AdminIterator</code>
Interfaces Have Been Deprecated</b>
<dd>

This release deprecates the <code><a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/JavaSpaceAdmin.html">
com.sun.jini.outrigger.JavaSpaceAdmin</a></code> and <code><a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/ConstrainableJavaSpaceAdmin.html">
com.sun.jini.outrigger.ConstrainableJavaSpaceAdmin</a></code>
interfaces. Outrigger's admin proxy still implements
<code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> (and if deployed with a Java(TM) Remote Method
Invocation implementation that supports remote method constraints,
<code>ConstrainableJavaSpaceAdmin</code>), but it is our intention to stop
doing so in a future release. The primary function provided by
<code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> and <code>ConstrainableJavaSpaceAdmin</code>
was the creation of <code><a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/AdminIterator.html">com.sun.jini.outrigger.AdminIterator</a></code>
instances that could be used to semi-exhaustively read through the contents
of the space. Similar functionality is now provided through the <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html#contents(java.util.Collection, net.jini.core.transaction.Transaction, long, long)">JavaSpace05.contents</a> </code> method. <p>

<code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> extends the <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/admin/JoinAdmin.html">net.jini.admin.JoinAdmin</a></code>
and <code><a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/admin/DestroyAdmin.html">com.sun.jini.admin.DestroyAdmin</a></code>
interfaces. It is our intention for Outrigger's admin proxy to continue
implementing <code>JoinAdmin</code> and <code>DestroyAdmin</code> after
support for <code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> is dropped.

<dt><b>Outrigger's JAR Files Have Been Restructured</b>
<dd>

To better support the layering of applications on top of the starter kit
the starter kit's JAR files, including those related to Outrigger, have
been restructured. The changes to the server-side files
(e.g. <code>outrigger.jar</code>, <code>outrigger-logstore.jar</code>,
etc.) may require changes to the security policy files used for Outrigger
servers. Permissions must now be granted to <code>jsk-lib.jar</code> in
addition to Outrigger's other server side JAR files. The changes to
<code>outrigger-dl.jar</code> have an impact on how Outrigger's codebase is
specified. Outrigger now requires a multi-element codebase that includes
both <code>outrigger-dl.jar</code> and <code>jsk-dl.jar</code>. Also note
that all of the starter kit's "<code>-dl.jar</code>" files, including
<code>outrigger-dl.jar</code>, have been moved out of the <code>lib</code>
directory and into the new <code>lib-dl</code> directory.<p>

For more details on the JAR file changes, please see the note in the Jini
Technology Starter Kit Release Notes on <a href="new.html#JARchanges">
JAR file changes</a>.
<p>

For examples on how to start Outrigger and a description of Outrigger JAR
file structure, please see <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html">Outrigger's
package documentation</a>.
<p>

<dt><b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b>
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>4754465:Race condition between logging takes and competing queries</b><dt>

<dd>
There was a race condition in persistent configurations of Outrigger that
theoretically allowed the effects of a non-transactional <code>take</code>,
non-transactional <code>takeIfExists</code>, or entry lease cancellation to
be made visible before the removal of the entry was made durable. This race
condition could give rise to scenarios where an entry flits out of, and
then back into existence. For example:

<ul>
<li> If there was a query, <em>Q</em>, that matched the entry
     <em>E</em>,
<li> and a concurrent operation, <em>O</em>, that was removing
     <em>E</em> but the space crashed between the time <em>O</em> removed
     <em>E</em> and the time <em>E</em>'s removal was made durable
     then,
<li> it was possible for <em>Q</em> to return <code>null</code>, implying
     that <em>O</em> had succeeded, and
<li> for a future query to return <em>E</em>, implying that <em>O</em>
     had failed.
</ul>

The race condition has been fixed in this release.


<p>

<dt><b>5002184:Blocking calls in server during destroy processing maxes CPU</b>
<dd>
The v2.0.n releases had a bug where if there was a blocked query
in progress when the <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/admin/DestroyAdmin.html#destroy()"><code>DestroyAdmin.destroy</code></a>
method was called, CPU usage would peak for up to two minutes and the
process of destroying the server would be delayed. This was caused by
Outrigger making repeated attempts to &#147nicely&#148 unexport the server
with no pause between attempts. This version addresses this issue by
introducing a pause between unexport attempts. This delay can be controlled
using the <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html#unexportRetryDelay"><code>unexportRetryDelay</code></a>
configuration entry. This version also introduces the <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html#maxUnexportDelay"><code>maxUnexportDelay</code></a>
configuration entry, which can be used to control how long Outrigger will
attempt nice unexport attempts before giving up and forcefully unexporting
itself (see the <code>maxUnexportDelay</code> configuration entry for more
details).
<p>



<dt><b>6201948:Outrigger fails to unblock takes when last conflicting read
lock is prepared</b><dt>


<dd>
Previous versions of Outrigger had a bug where Outrigger would not generate
the correct internal events when an entry was read locked by two
transactions and one of the transactions was prepared (Note Outrigger would
generate the proper internal events if one of the two transactions was
aborted, or if the entry was read locked by only one transaction and that
transaction was prepared). <p>

What this meant in practice was that if you had entry, <em>E</em>, read
locked under two transactions <em>T1</em>, and <em>T2</em> and a blocked
<code>take</code> (or <code>takeIfExists</code>) under <em>T1</em> whose
template matched <em>E</em>, then the <code>take</code> would not unblock
if <em>T2</em> was prepared (the <code>take</code> would unblock if
<em>T2</em> was aborted) even though the prepare resolved the last
conflicting transaction. A <code>take</code> (or <code>takeIfExists</code>)
under <em>T1</em> started after the prepare of <em>T2</em> would function
properly. The take would also eventually unblock if the <em>maximum server
query timeout</em> feature was being used.
<p>

<dt><b>6307184:Deadlock between adding entries and iteration</b>

<dd>
Previous 2.n versions of Outrigger had a bug where attempts to iterate over the
space using the <code><a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/AdminIterator.html">com.sun.jini.outrigger.AdminIterator</a></code>
or the <code><a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html#contents">net.jini.space.JavaSpace05.contents</a></code> method
while at the same time writing entries of a type the iteration could return
would cause a deadlock.  Note, in practice this was much more likely
to happen with <code>AdminIterator</code> than <code>contents</code>.
<p>

This issue has been fixed in this release.
