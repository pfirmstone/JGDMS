<p>The Jini surrogate architecture allows other Programming language software and non jvm devices to participate in a djinn by uploading bytecode to a surrogate which provides a Jini service on behalf of the device or software.

The Jini Surrogate Architecture is currently a dormant project on <a href="<a href="https://surrogate.dev.java.net/">java.net</a>

The specifications and source code are provided.

The specification documents are pdf and contain the Apache 2.0 License Headers (on the last page).
 I have inspected the *.java source files, each contains and Apache 2.0 License Header and Sun Microsystems Copyright.
 No Authors names appear in the source files, only Sun Microsystems.

Keith Thompson is the project owner and worked for Sun Microsystems while the project was active.
