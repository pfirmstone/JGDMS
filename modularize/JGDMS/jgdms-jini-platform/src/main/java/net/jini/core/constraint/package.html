Defines constraints and collections of constraints that can be used to control
method invocation, and an interface that proxies implement to allow clients
to specify constraints for remote method calls. Clients control remote calls
using <a href="#constraints">constraints</a>. The client attaches the
constraints to a proxy by calling a method on the
<a href="#remote_control"><code>RemoteMethodControl</code> interface</a>
implemented by the proxy. At each remote call through a proxy, the proxy
implementation is responsible for using communication mechanisms that satisfy
the client's constraints. If the constraints cannot be satisfied, the proxy
throws a {@link java.rmi.ConnectIOException}.

<a name="constraints"></a><h2>Invocation Constraints</h2>

All constraint classes implement the
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.InvocationConstraint} interface.
The constraint mechanism is designed to be extensible; the constraint classes
defined in this package should be adequate for many applications, but
additional constraint classes, either generic in nature or specific to a
particular mechanism or service, can be defined as necessary. By design, the
constraints defined in this package express <i>what</i> control is desired,
not <i>how</i> that control should be achieved; the constraints are not tied
to specific algorithms, mechanisms, or protocols. Although most of the
constraints defined in this package are related to trust mechanisms, it is
intended and expected that a wide variety of constraints will be defined,
particularly in the area of quality of service.
<p>
The basic trust-related constraints are very simple:
<ul>
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.AtomicValidation} - to make sure
that untrusted messages and objects (the data) sent
over the network that could potentially be tampered with by third parties 
cannot do harm.  Without this constraint, many of the following constraints
are subject to reference stealing attacks during serialization.
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.Integrity} - to make sure
that the messages and objects (not just data, but also downloaded code) sent
over the network are not tampered with by third parties
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerAuthentication} - to
prove to the client that the server is executing on behalf of some subject, so
that the call can be terminated if the subject is not trusted by the client.
The flip side of this is anonymity: to allow a server to remain anonymous when
it wants to be.
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientAuthentication} - to
prove to the server that the client is executing on behalf of some subject, so
that the server can perform only those tasks for which the subject is
authorized. The flip side of this is anonymity: to allow a client to remain
anonymous when it wants to be.
<li><a name="delegation"</a>
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.Delegation} - to allow the
server to authenticate as the client in remote calls made and received by the
server, to allow the server to act on a client's behalf when dealing with third
parties, in cases where the identity of the client (not the server) is what
matters to those parties.
</ul>
<p>
There are also constraints to control which principals of a client or server
subject must be authenticated, and which principals of a client are permitted
to be authenticated:
<ul>
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMinPrincipal} - to
require a client to authenticate as at least some specific principals
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMaxPrincipal} - to
require a client to authenticate as at most some specific principals
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMinPrincipalType} - to
require a client to authenticate as at least some specific types of principals
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ClientMaxPrincipalType} - to
require a client to authenticate as at most some specific types of principals
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerMinPrincipal} - to
require a server to authenticate as at least some specific principals
</ul>
<p>
(There is no <code>ServerMaxPrincipal</code> constraint; a client
should not need to impose such a maximum, and a server can impose a maximum
by limiting the contents of the subject it uses for network authentication.)
<p>
There are also constraints to control the time during which a server is
permitted to exercise delegation:
<ul>
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.DelegationAbsoluteTime} - to
specify a range of absolute times
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.DelegationRelativeTime} - to
specify a range of times relative to the start of the remote call
</ul>
Other constraints defined in this package are:
<ul>
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConnectionRelativeTime} -
to control the maximum amount of time to wait for a network connection to be
established
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConnectionAbsoluteTime} -
to control the maximum absolute time by which a network connection must be
established
<li>{@link net.jini.core.constraint.Confidentiality} - to make
sure that the data sent over the network cannot be interpreted by third parties
</ul>
<p>
There are no explicit <i>don't care</i> constraints; a <i>don't care</i>
condition is expressed by the <i>absence</i> of constraints.
<p>
Constraints can be combined using
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ConstraintAlternatives} to
express alternatives, such that at least one of the individual constraints
must be satisfied (but not all have to be satisfied) for the aggregate
constraint to be satisfied.
<p>
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.InvocationConstraints}
aggregates constraints into a set of requirements and a set of preferences. A
requirement is a mandatory constraint that must be satisfied. A preference is
a desired constraint, to be satisfied if possible, but it will not be
satisfied if it conflicts with a requirement. If two preferences conflict,
it is arbitrary as to which one will be satisfied. If a constraint is not
understood, due to lack of knowledge of the type of the constraint or the
contents of the constraint, then the constraint cannot be satisfied.
<p>
Finally, {@link net.jini.core.constraint.MethodConstraints}
defines a mapping from {@link java.lang.reflect.Method} to
<code>InvocationConstraints</code>, allowing different constraints to be
specified for different methods. For example, a client might require client
authentication for write operations but not for read operations, or a client
might care about the confidentiality of some remote calls but not others.
<p>
Although the emphasis in this discussion has been on how clients use
constraints, constraints typically are also used by servers to specify their
minimum requirements for remote calls. When a remote object is exported, the
server's constraints normally are copied from the exporter into the returned
proxy, so that the proxy knows the minimum constraints required to communicate
with the server. Note that constraints are not used to specify server-side
authorization (access control) policy.

<a name="remote_control"></a>
<h2><code>RemoteMethodControl</code> interface</h2>

Proxies implement the
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl} interface
to allow clients to impose constraints on remote calls. If a proxy implements
this interface, then the semantics of this interface apply to all calls
through all remote methods defined by the proxy; there is no mechanism to
exempt remote methods or remote interfaces from these semantics.
<p>
Constraints for a remote call come from two sources:
<ul>
<li>Client constraints placed on a proxy
<li>Constraints imposed by the server (including any minimum constraints
imposed by the communication mechanism used between the proxy and server)
</ul>
The client constraints placed on a proxy are specified with a
<code>MethodConstraints</code> instance, so the client can specify different
constraints for each remote method. Client constraints placed directly on a
proxy apply to all remote calls made through that particular proxy by any
thread. The server constraints are controlled by the proxy implementation;
they are not exposed to the client, and might vary in ways unknown to the
client (for example, vary by method or over time). The client should set the
constraints it wants rather than assuming that the server imposes particular
constraints.
<p>
A remote call will be performed only if the combined requirements (from both
sources) can be satisfied. If the requirements cannot be satisfied, the proxy
throws a {@link java.rmi.ConnectIOException}, typically containing (but not
required to contain) a nested
{@link net.jini.io.UnsupportedConstraintException}. In addition
to the requirements, both client and server preferences will be satisfied, to
the extent possible. Note that it is possible to specify conflicting
constraints, meaning they cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Preferences that
conflict with requirements are ignored, and if preferences conflict with each
other it is arbitrary as to which (if any) are satisfied, but if there are
conflicting requirements the remote call will not be made.
