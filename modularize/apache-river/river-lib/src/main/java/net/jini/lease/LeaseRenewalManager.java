/**
 * Provides for the systematic renewal and overall management of a set
 * of leases associated with one or more remote entities on behalf of a
 * local entity.
 * <p>
 * This class removes much of the administrative burden associated with
 * lease renewal. Clients of the renewal manager simply give their
 * leases to the manager and the manager renews each lease as necessary
 * to achieve a <em>desired expiration</em> time (which may be later
 * than the lease's current <em>actual expiration</em> time). Failures
 * encountered while renewing a lease can optionally be reflected to the
 * client via <code>LeaseRenewalEvent</code> instances.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is not remote. Entities wishing to use this
 * class must create an instance of this class in their own virtual
 * machine to locally manage the leases granted to them. If the virtual
 * machine that the manager was created in exits or crashes, the renewal
 * manager will be destroyed.
 * <p>
 * The <code>LeaseRenewalManager</code> distinguishes between two time
 * values associated with lease expiration: the <em>desired
 * expiration</em> time for the lease, and the <em>actual
 * expiration</em> time granted when the lease is created or last
 * renewed. The desired expiration represents when the client would like
 * the lease to expire. The actual expiration represents when the lease
 * is going to expire if it is not renewed. Both time values are
 * absolute times, not relative time durations. The desired expiration
 * time can be retrieved using the renewal manager's
 * <code>getExpiration</code> method. The actual expiration time of a
 * lease object can be retrieved by invoking the lease's
 * <code>getExpiration</code> method.
 * <p>
 * Each lease in the managed set also has two other associated
 * attributes: a desired <em>renewal duration</em>, and a <em>remaining
 * desired duration</em>. The desired renewal duration is specified
 * (directly or indirectly) when the lease is added to the set. This
 * duration must normally be a positive number; however, it may be
 * <code>Lease.ANY</code> if the lease's desired expiration is
 * <code>Lease.FOREVER</code>. The remaining desired duration is always
 * the desired expiration less the current time.
 * <p>
 * Each time a lease is renewed, the renewal manager will ask for an
 * extension equal to the lease's renewal duration if the renewal
 * duration is:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>Lease.ANY</code>, or 
 * <li> less than the remaining desired duration,
 * </ul>
 * otherwise it will ask for an extension equal to the lease's remaining
 * desired duration.
 * <p>
 * Once a lease is given to a lease renewal manager, the manager will
 * continue to renew the lease until one of the following occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The lease's desired or actual expiration time is reached.
 * <li> An explicit removal of the lease from the set is requested via a
 *	<code>cancel</code>, <code>clear</code>, or <code>remove</code>
 *	call on the renewal manager.
 * <li> The renewal manager tries to renew the lease and gets a bad
 *	object exception, bad invocation exception, or
 *	<code>LeaseException</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The methods of this class are appropriately synchronized for
 * concurrent operation. Additionally, this class makes certain
 * guarantees with respect to concurrency. When this class makes a
 * remote call (for example, when requesting the renewal of a lease),
 * any invocations made on the methods of this class will not be
 * blocked. Similarly, this class makes a reentrancy guarantee with
 * respect to the listener objects registered with this class. Should
 * this class invoke a method on a registered listener (a local call),
 * calls from that method to any other method of this class are
 * guaranteed not to result in a deadlock condition.

 * <p>
 * <a name="algorithm"><b>The renewal algorithm</b></a></p>
 * <p>
 * The time at which a lease is scheduled for renewal is based on the
 * expiration time of the lease, possibly adjusted to account for the
 * latency of the remote renewal call. The configuration entry
 * <code>roundTripTime</code>, which defaults to ten seconds, represents
 * the total time to make the remote call.</p>
 * <p>
 * The following pseudocode was derived from the code which computes
 * the renewal time. In this code, <code>rtt</code> represents the
 * value of the <code>roundTripTime</code>:</p>
 *
 * <pre>    
 *          endTime = lease.getExpiration();
 *          delta = endTime - now;
 *          if (delta &lt;= rtt * 2) {
 *	        delta = rtt;
 *          } else if (delta &lt;= rtt * 8) {
 *	        delta /= 2;
 *          } else if (delta &lt;= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7) {
 *	        delta /= 8;
 *          } else if (delta &lt;= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 14) {
 *	        delta = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
 *          } else {
 *	        delta = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 3;
 *          }
 *          renew = endTime - delta;
 *</pre>
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that <code>delta</code> is never less than
 * <code>rtt</code> when the renewal time is computed. A lease which 
 * would expire within this time range will be scheduled for immediate
 * renewal. The use of very short lease durations (at or below <code>rtt</code>)
 * can cause the renewal manager to effectively ignore the lease duration
 * and repeatedly schedule the lease for immediate renewal.
 * </p><p>
 * If an attempt to renew a lease fails with an indefinite exception, a
 * renewal is rescheduled with an updated renewal time as computed by the
 * following pseudocode:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *          delta = endTime - renew;
 *          if (delta &gt; rtt) {
 *              if (delta &lt;= rtt * 3) {
 *	            delta = rtt;
 *              } else if (delta &lt;= 1000 * 60 * 60) {
 *	            delta /= 3;
 *              } else if (delta &lt;= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24) {
 *	            delta = 1000 * 60 * 30;
 *              } else if (delta &lt;= 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7) {
 *	            delta = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 3;
 *              } else {
 *	            delta = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 8;
 *              }
 *              renew += delta;
 *          }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Client leases are maintained in a collection sorted by descending renewal
 * time. A renewal thread is spawned whenever the renewal time of the last lease
 * in the collection is reached. This renewal thread examines all of the leases
 * in the collection whose renewal time falls within
 * <code>renewBatchTimeWindow</code> milliseconds of the renewal time of the
 * last lease. If any of these leases can be batch renewed with the last lease (as
 * determined by calling the {@link Lease#canBatch canBatch} method of
 * the last lease) then a {@link LeaseMap} is created, all eligible leases
 * are added to it and the {@link LeaseMap#renewAll} method is called. Otherwise, the
 * last lease is renewed directly.
 * <p> 
 * The <code>ExecutorService</code> that manages the renewal threads has a bound on
 * the number of simultaneous threads it will support. The renewal time of
 * leases may be adjusted earlier in time to reduce the likelihood that the
 * renewal of a lease will be delayed due to exhaustion of the thread pool.
 * Actual renewal times are determined by starting with the lease with the
 * latest (farthest off) desired renewal time and working backwards.  When
 * computing the actual renewal time for a lease, the renewals of all leases
 * with later renewal times, which will be initiated during the round trip time
 * of the current lease's renewal, are considered.  If using the desired
 * renewal time for the current lease would result in more in-progress renewals
 * than the number of threads allowed, the renewal time of the current lease is
 * shifted earlier in time, such that the maximum number of threads is not
 * exceeded.

     * the renewal duration associated with that lease will be replaced
     * with the new listener, desired expiration, and renewal duration.
     * <p>
     * The lease will remain in the set until one of the following
     * occurs:
     * <ul>
     * <li> The lease's desired or actual expiration time is reached.
     * <li> An explicit removal of the lease from the set is requested

     * <p>
     * This method will interpret the value of the
     * <code>desiredExpiration</code> argument as the desired absolute
     * system time after which the lease is no longer valid. This

     * object exception, or bad invocation exception (collectively these
     * are referred to as <em>definite exceptions</em>) during a renewal
     * attempt or the lease's actual expiration being reached before its
     * desired expiration.
     * <p>
     * If a definite exception occurs during a lease renewal request,
     * the exception will be wrapped in an instance of the
     * <code>LeaseRenewalEvent</code> class and sent to the listener.
     * <p>
     * If an indefinite exception occurs during a renewal request for
     * the lease, renewal requests will continue to be made for that
     * lease until: the lease is renewed successfully, a renewal attempt
     * results in a definite exception, or the lease's actual expiration
