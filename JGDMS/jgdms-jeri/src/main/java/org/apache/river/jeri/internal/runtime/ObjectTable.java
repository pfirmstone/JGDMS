             * In the server-side DGC implementation's thread that check's for
             * lease expirations 
             * (org.apache.river.jeri.internal.runtime.ObjectTable.LeaseChecker.run),
             * it checks for them while synchronized on the overall lease table,
             * but it delays notifying the expired leases' individual registered
             * Targets about the expirations until after it has released the
             * lease table lock. This approach was taken from the 
             * JRMP implementation, which is that way because of the fix 
             * for 4118056 (a previous deadlock bug-- but now, I'm thinking 
             * that the JRMP implementation has this bug too).
             *
             * The problem seems to be that after releasing the lease table 
             * lock, it is possible for another lease renewal/request to 
             * come in (from the same DGC client and for the same remote object)
             * that would then be invalidated by the subsequent Target 
             * notification made by the lease expiration check thread-- and 
             * thus the client's lease renewal (for that remote object) will 
             * be forgotten. It would appear that the synchronization approach 
             * here needs to be reconsidered.
             * 
             * ( Comments note: )
             * In addition to the basic problem of the expired-then-renewed 
             * client being removed from the referenced set, there is also 
             * the problem of the sequence table entry being forgotten-- which 
             * prevents detection of a "late clean call".
             * Normally, late clean calls are not a problem because sequence 
             * numbers are retained while the client is in the referenced set 
             * (and there is no such thing as a "strong dirty"). 
             * But in this case, with the following order of events on 
             * the server side:
             *
             *   1. dirty, seqNo=2
             *   2. (lease expiration)
             *   3. clean, seqNo=1
             *
             * The primary bug here is that the first two events will leave 
             * the client missing from the referenced set. But the secondary 
             * bug is that even if that's fixed, with the sequence number 
             * forgotten, the third event (the "late clean call") will still 
             * cause the client to be removed from the referenced set.
             * 
             * FIX:
             * This issue has been fixed by making the Lease responsible for
             * it's own state, which is protected internally by synchronization.
             * The lease checker passes the time to the Lease, which checks 
             * itself and notifies the Targets in the event of expiry.
             * 
             * Because the notification is not delayed, the client id and
             * sequence number will not be not be removed by the LeaseChecker
             * thread after being updated by the second dirty call (when
             * the lock was cleared as described).
             * 
             * The client id and sequence number are added to the Target sequence
             * table by the second dirty call, after the Lease removes
             * them immediately upon expiry being invoked by the LeaseChecker.
             * 
             * Then because the late clean call sequence number is less than the 
             * second dirty call and exists, it is correctly recognised.
