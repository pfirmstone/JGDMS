/**
 * ConnectionIO is an abstraction over a bi-directional byte stream
 * connection that provides the following features:
 *
 * - methods for sending sequences of bytes over the connection atomically
 *   (with respect to other threads) and asynchronously, with the option of
 *   receiving a notification when a given sequence has been written (i.e.
 *   when the buffer used to pass the sequence may again be used)
 *
 * - callbacks invoked on the host Mux object to process data that has been
 *   received over the connection, whenever new data arrives
 *
 * The ConnectionIO API uses java.nio.ByteBuffer objects to represent
 * sequences of bytes for writing or reading.
 *
 * The abstraction is intended to be implementable for both blocking
 * streams (requiring separate read and write threads per connection) and
 * non-blocking selectable channels (using a select-based I/O event handler
 * for completing I/O operations that would otherwise block).
