/**
 * AbstractDgcClient implements the client-side behavior of JERI's
 * distributed garbage collection system abstractly with respect to
 * the types used to represent live remote references.  
 * The actual type used for live references depends on the concrete subclass.
 *
 * The entry point into the machinery of AbstractDgcClient is the
 * "registerRefs" method: when a live reference enters the scope of
 * this AbstractDgcClient (the current virtual machine, for example),
 * it should be registered with that method in order for it to
 * participate in distributed garbage collection.
 *
 * When the first live reference to a particular remote object is
 * registered, a "dirty" call is made to the server-side distributed
 * garbage collector at the remote object's endpoint, which, if
 * successful, returns a lease guaranteeing that the server-side DGC
 * will not collect the remote object for a certain period of time.
 * While live references to remote objects at a particular endpoint
 * exist, this AbstractDgcClient will continue to make more "dirty"
 * calls to renew its lease on the referenced remote objects.
 *
 * This AbstractDgcClient tracks the local reachability of registered
 * live references (using phantom references).  When all of the live
 * reference instances for a particular remote object become garbage
 * collected locally, a "clean" call is made to the server-side
 * distributed garbage collector, indicating that the server no longer
 * needs to keep the remote object alive for this client.
 *
 * Internally, AbstractDgcClient holds and manipulates transport
 * endpoints, object IDs, and live references with references of type
 * java.lang.Object; it is assumed that their actual classes define
 * "equals" and "hashCode" in a meaningful way.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must provide additional behavior for the actual
 * endpoint, object ID, and live reference types by implementing the
 * abstract protected methods of this class (see below).  In
 * particular, the "getDgcProxy" method should return an object that
 * implements the actual protocol for DGC "dirty" and "clean" calls
 * for the endpoint type being used, the "freeEndpoint" method may
 * make use of the indication that a particular endpoint no longer has
 * references, and the "getRefEndpoint" and "getRefObjectID" methods
 * should return the endpoint and object ID contained in a particular
 * live reference object.  A concrete subclass should also provide a
 * type-safe equivalent of "registerRefs" that delegates to this
 * class's "registerRefs" method.
