/**
 * Provides server-side connection management using the <a
 * href="{@docRoot}/net/jini/jeri/connection/doc-files/mux.html">Jini
 * extensible remote invocation (Jini ERI) multiplexing protocol</a>
 * to frame and multiplex requests and responses over connections.
 *
 * <p>A <code>ServerConnectionManager</code> is created by a
 * connection-based {@link net.jini.jeri.ServerEndpoint} implemention to manage
 * connections.  The {@link #handleConnection handleConnection} method
 * is used to manage connections for a particular {@link
 * ServerConnection}.
 *
 * <p>Each <i>session</i> of the Jini ERI multiplexing protocol is
 * mapped to a new request.  Request data is read as the data received
 * for the session, and response data is written as the data sent for
 * the session.
