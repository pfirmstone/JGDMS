/**
 * An <code>Exporter</code> implementation for exporting
 * a remote object to use Jini extensible remote invocation
 * (Jini ERI).  Typically, instances of this class should be
 * obtained from a {@link Configuration} rather than being explicitly
 * constructed.
 * Each instance of <code>BasicJeriExporter</code>
 * can export only a single remote object.
 *
 * <p>The following properties (defined during construction) govern
 * invocation behavior and other characteristics of the exported remote
 * object and its proxy:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ServerEndpoint}: the <code>ServerEndpoint</code> over
 * which calls are accepted.
 *
 * <li><p>{@link InvocationLayerFactory}: a factory used to obtain the remote
 * object's proxy and invocation dispatcher.
 *
 * <li><p><i>enableDGC</i> flag: if <code>true</code>, distributed
 * garbage collection (DGC) is enabled for the exported remote object,
 * and the {@link BasicObjectEndpoint} produced by this exporter
 * participates in DGC and thus constitutes a strong remote reference
 * to the remote object; if <code>false</code>, DGC is not enabled for
 * the remote object, and the <code>BasicObjectEndpoint</code> does
 * not participate in DGC and thus is a weak remote reference, so it
 * does not prevent the remote object from being garbage collected.
 *
 * <li><p><i>keepAlive</i> flag: if <code>true</code>, the virtual
 * machine is kept alive (with a non-daemon thread) while the remote
 * object remains exported via this exporter.
 *
 * <li><p>{@link Uuid Uuid}: the object identifier to use for the
 * remote object; if <code>null</code>, a unique object identifier is
 * chosen for the remote object using {@link UuidFactory#generate
 * UuidFactory.generate}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If DGC is not enabled for a remote object, then the
 * implementation always only weakly references the remote object.  If
 * DGC is enabled for a remote object, then the implementation weakly
 * references the remote object when its referenced set is empty and
 * strongly references the remote object when its referenced set is
 * not empty (see below).  If the implementation weakly references the
 * remote object and the weak reference is cleared, the remote object
 * becomes effectively unexported.
 * </p>
 * <p>Enabling DGC is not advisable in some circumstances.  DGC should
 * not be enabled for a remote object exported with a well known
 * object identifier.  Enabling DGC with a secure remote object is
 * generally discouraged, because DGC communication is always made in
 * a client-side context in which there are no client constraints and
 * no client subject, so it can leave the remote object open to denial
 * of service attacks.  Some transport providers may not support making
 * requests without a client subject, so even if DGC is enabled in the
 * case where such a transport provider is used, DGC will be effectively
 * disabled on the client side.
 * </p>
 * <p>Multiple remote objects can be exported on the same server endpoint,
 * and the same remote object can be exported multiple times on different
 * server endpoints with the only restriction being that a given pair of
 * object identifier and listen endpoint (derived from the server endpoint)
 * can only have one active export at any given time.
 * </p>
 * <p>Two instances of this class are equal only if they are references to
 * the same (<code>==</code>) object.
 * </p>
 * <p>The server endpoint is not transmitted in the remote reference; only the
 * derived client endpoint is transmitted.
 * </p>
 * <p>Remote objects exported with instances of this class can call {@link
 * ServerContext#getServerContextElement
 * ServerContext.getServerContextElement}, passing the class {@link
 * ClientSubject} to obtain the authenticated identity of the client (if
 * any) for an incoming remote call, or passing the class {@link
 * ClientHost} to obtain the address of the client host.
 * </p>
 * <p>For remote objects exported with instances of this class, there is no
 * automatic replacement of the proxy for the remote object during
 * marshalling; either the proxy must be passed explicitly, or the remote
 * object implementation class must be serializable and have a
 * <code>writeReplace</code> method that returns its proxy.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Distributed Garbage Collection</h1>
 * <p>
 * The <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> class acts as the server-side
 * DGC implementation for all remote objects exported with DGC enabled
 * using its instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>An entity known as the <i>DGC client</i> tracks the existence
 * and reachability of live remote references
 * (<code>BasicObjectEndpoint</code> instances that participate in
 * DGC) for a <code>BasicObjectEndpoint</code> class in some
 * (potentially) remote virtual machine.  A DGC client is identified
 * by a universally unique identifier (a <code>Uuid</code>).  A DGC
 * client sends <i>dirty calls</i> and <i>clean calls</i> to the
 * {@link Endpoint} of a live remote reference to inform the
 * server-side DGC implementation when the number of live remote
 * references to a given remote object it is tracking increases from
 * zero to greater than zero and decreases from greater than zero to
 * zero, respectively.  A DGC client also sends dirty calls to the
 * <code>Endpoint</code> of live remote references it is tracking to
 * renew its lease.  The client-side behavior of dirty and clean calls
 * is specified by {@link BasicObjectEndpoint}.
 *
 * <p>On the server side, for every remote object exported with DGC
 * enabled, the implementation maintains a <i>referenced set</i>,
 * which contains the <code>Uuid</code>s of the DGC clients that are
 * known to have live remote references to the remote object.  The
 * contents of the referenced set are modified as a result of dirty
 * calls, clean calls, and expiration of leases (see below).  While
 * the referenced set is not empty, the implementation strongly
 * references the remote object, so that it will not be garbage
 * collected.  While the referenced set is empty, the implementation
 * only weakly references the remote object, so that it may be garbage
 * collected (if it is not otherwise strongly reachable locally).  If
 * a remote object is garbage collected, it becomes effectively
 * unexported.  If a remote object that is an instance of {@link
 * Unreferenced} is exported with DGC enabled, then whenever the size
 * of its referenced set transitions from greater than zero to zero,
 * its {@link Unreferenced#unreferenced unreferenced} method will be
 * invoked (before the strong reference is dropped).  Note that a
 * referenced set spans multiple exports of the same (identical)
 * remote object with <code>BasicJeriExporter</code>.
 *
 * <p>For every <code>RequestDispatcher</code> passed by
 * <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> to a <code>ListenEndpoint</code> as
 * part of exporting, whenever it has at least one remote object
 * exported with DGC enabled, it also has an implicitly exported
 * remote object that represents the server-side DGC implementation.
 * This remote object is effectively exported with an object
 * identifier of <code>d32cd1bc-273c-11b2-8841-080020c9e4a1</code> and
 * an <code>InvocationDispatcher</code> that behaves like a {@link
 * BasicInvocationDispatcher} with no server constraints, with a
 * {@link BasicInvocationDispatcher#createMarshalInputStream
 * createMarshalInputStream} implementation that returns a {@link
 * MarshalInputStream} that ignores codebase annotations, and with
 * support for at least the following remote methods:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     long dirty(Uuid clientID, long sequenceNum, Uuid[] ids)
 *         throws {@link RemoteException};
 *
 *     void clean(Uuid clientID, long sequenceNum, Uuid[] ids, boolean strong)
 *         throws RemoteException;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <code>clientID</code> identifies the DGC client that is making the
 * dirty or clean call, and <code>sequenceNum</code> identifies the
 * sequence number of the dirty or clean call with respect to other
 * dirty and clean calls from the same DGC client.  The sequence
 * numbers identify the correct order of semantic interpretation of
 * dirty and clean calls from the same DGC client, regardless of the
 * order in which they arrive.  The well-known object identifier for
 * the server-side DGC implementation is reserved; attempting to
 * export any other remote object with that object identifier always
 * throws an {@link ExportException}.
 *
 * <p>A dirty call is processed as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>It establishes or renews the DGC lease for the identified DGC
 * client.  The duration of the granted lease, which is chosen by the
 * implementation, is conveyed as the value returned by the dirty
 * call, in milliseconds starting from the some time during the
 * processing of the dirty call.  While the lease for a DGC client is
 * valid (not expired), the DGC client is preserved in referenced sets
 * of exported remote objects.
 *
 * <li><p>It adds the DGC client's <code>Uuid</code> to the referenced
 * sets of the exported remote objects identified by <code>ids</code>,
 * if any, so that they are prevented from being garbage collected.
 * For each <code>Uuid</code> in <code>ids</code>:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * The identified remote object is the remote object exported with
 * that <code>Uuid</code> on the <code>ListenEndpoint</code> (and thus
 * <code>RequestDispatcher</code>) that the dirty call was received
 * on.  If no such exported remote object exists (for example, if it
 * has been garbage collected), then that <code>Uuid</code> in
 * <code>ids</code> is ignored.  If the sequence number is less than
 * the last recorded sequence number of a dirty or clean call for the
 * identified remote object from the same DGC client, then the remote
 * object's referenced set is not modified.  Otherwise, the DGC
 * client's <code>Uuid</code> is added to the remote object's
 * referenced set (if not already present).  If this addition causes
 * the referenced set to transition from empty to non-empty, then the
 * implementation starts strongly referencing the remote object.
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A clean call is processed as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>It removes the DGC client's <code>Uuid</code> from the
 * referenced sets of the exported remote objects identified by
 * <code>ids</code>, so that they are not prevented from being garbage
 * collected by the given DGC client.  For each <code>Uuid</code> in
 * <code>ids</code>:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <p>The identified remote object is the remote object exported with
 * that <code>Uuid</code> on the <code>ListenEndpoint</code> (and thus
 * <code>RequestDispatcher</code>) that the dirty call was received
 * on.  If no such exported remote object exists (for example, if it
 * has been garbage collected), then that <code>Uuid</code> in
 * <code>ids</code> is ignored.  If the sequence number is less then
 * the last recorded sequence number of a dirty or clean call for the
 * identified remote object from the same DGC client, then the remote
 * object's referenced set is not modified.  Otherwise, the DGC
 * client's <code>Uuid</code> is removed from the remote object's
 * referenced set (if it is present).  If this removal causes the
 * referenced set to transition from non-empty to empty, then the
 * implementation starts only weakly referencing the remote object
 * (and before doing so, if the remote object is an instance of
 * <code>Unreferenced</code>, its <code>unreferenced</code> method is
 * invoked).  If <code>strong</code> is <code>true</code>, then a
 * record is kept of the specified sequence number from the DGC client
 * for some reasonable period of time, in the event of a dirty call
 * that might arrive later with a lower sequence number.
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the implementation detects that the most recently granted DGC
 * lease for a given DGC client has expired, then it assumes that the
 * DGC client has abnormally terminated, and the DGC client's
 * <code>Uuid</code> is removed from the referenced sets of all
 * exported remote objects.  If this removal causes a referenced set
 * to transition from non-empty to empty, then the implementation
 * starts only weakly referencing the corresponding remote object (and
 * before doing so, if the remote object is an instance of
 * <code>Unreferenced</code>, its <code>unreferenced</code> method is
 * invoked).
 *
 * <p>Unexporting a remote object with a
 * <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> causes the removal of DGC client
 * <code>Uuid</code>s from the remote object's referenced set that
 * were only present because of dirty calls that were received as a
 * result of exporting it with that <code>BasicJeriExporter</code>.
 * If the remote object remains exported with DGC enabled by another
 * <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> and this removal causes the
 * referenced set to transition from non-empty to empty, then the
 * implementation starts only weakly referencing the remote object
 * (and before doing so, if the remote object is an instance of
 * <code>Unreferenced</code>, its <code>unreferenced</code> method is
 * invoked).
 *
 * <p>When the implementation invokes a remote object's
 * <code>unreferenced</code> method, it does so with the security
 * context and context class loader in effect when the remote object
 * was exported.  If the remote object is currently exported more than
 * once, then the security context and context class loader in effect
 * for any one of those exports are used.

     * to the response output stream, and closes the response output
     * stream.  Otherwise, it writes <code>0x01</code> to the response
     * output stream, and invokes the {@link InvocationDispatcher#dispatch

     *     in effect.
     * <li>The context class loader is the context class loader
     *     in effect when this method was invoked.
     * <li>Each call to the dispatcher is made using {@link

     *     ServerContext.doWithServerContext} with a server context
     *     collection that is an unmodifiable view of the context
