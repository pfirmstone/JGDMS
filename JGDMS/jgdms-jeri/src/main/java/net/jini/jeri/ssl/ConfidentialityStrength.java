     * RFC 7525 Current best practice, if confidentiality of message contents 
     * is ensured, then use strong confidentiality for message contents. <p>
     * STRONG confidentiality isn't possible, unless both client and server
     * are authenticated.
     * <p>
     * Guidance:
     * <ul>
     * <li> Keys used for strong encryption must not be shared by WEAK encryption connections.
     * <li> Public Keys lengths used must follow the guidance of RFC 7525.
     * <li> DHE_DSS and ECDHE_ECDSA key exchanges are allowed in addition to
     * those recommended in RFC 7525.
     * </ul>
     *
     * For the endpoints in this package, this constraint is supported by
     * cipher suites with the following cipher algorithms:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> AES_128_GCM
     * <li> AES_256_GCM
     * <li> CHACHA20_POLY1305
     * <li> AES_128_CCM
     * <li> AES_128_CCM_8
     * </ul>
     * 
     * Key exchange is limited to the following ephemeral protocols with forward
     * secrecy for TLS v1.2 and earlier.
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li> ECDHE_RSA
     * <li> DHE_RSA
