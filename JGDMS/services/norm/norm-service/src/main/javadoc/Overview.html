<H3>Description</H3>
"Norm" is the name of the contributed Jini technology lease renewal
service implementation from Sun Microsystems. The <i>River Lease Renewal
Service Specification</i> is available in <a
href="../specs/html/lrs-spec.html">html</a>.
<p>
The specification for Norm is defined not only by the <i>River Lease
Renewal Service Specification</i>, but also by the API documentation
(generated by the Javadoc(TM) tool) for <a
href="../api/net/jini/admin/Administrable.html">
<code>Administrable</code></a>.
<p>
<H3>Changes since the v2.2.0 release</H3>

<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-287'>RIVER-287</a>] - [PATCH] avoid race condition problems for taking snapshots
<H3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</H3>

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Configuration</b>
  <dd> In this release, no new configuration entries have been added, nor have any other
       changes occurred with respect to the configuration.
       <p>
       A full list of supported configuration entries is given in this service's
       <a href="../api/org/apache/river/norm/package-summary.html#configuration"> man page</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <b>Logging</b>
  <dd> In this release, no changes have occurred with respect to the logging mechanism
       employed by Norm, which logs diagnostic information using a separate
       <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html"> <code>Logger</code></a>
       for each type of information logged. The name of each logger
       is a dot-separated concatenation of the implementation package name,
       <code>org.apache.river.norm</code>, with a descriptive string. A description
of each
       logger used by this service, as well as what information is logged to which
       logger, and at what logging level, is given in this service's
       <a href="../api/org/apache/river/norm/package-summary.html#logging"> man page</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b>
  <dd> A number of bugs have been addressed in this release of Norm.
       What follows is a description of those bugs that might be of
       interest:
  <p>

  <dt><b>4965775: Norm threads should guard against lost interrupts</b><dt>

  <dd> Thread subclasses in Norm that use logging and do not override the
       <code>Thread.interrupt</code> method to set an "interrupted" field are
       susceptable to lost interrupts.  This problem can occur because
       <code>java.util.logging</code> swallows internal
       <code>InterruptedIOExceptions</code> without setting the receiving
       thread's interrupted status, effectively forgetting the interrupt.  The
       end result is that some of Norm's threads could loop endlessly instead of       terminating, causing Norm shutdowns to hang.
       <p>
       This bug has been fixed.
