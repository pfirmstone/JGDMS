     * 'remote state' of this registration's currently discovered lookup
     * service(s). This method returns a new array on each invocation.
     * <p>
     * To obtain the desired lookup service proxies, this method sends a
     * request to the the lookup discovery service. Upon receiving the
     * request, the lookup discovery service sends the requested set of
     * proxies as a set of marshalled instances of the ServiceRegistrar
     * interface. Thus, in order to construct the return set, this method
     * attempts to unmarshal each element of the set received from the

     * to unmarshal any of the elements of the received set of marshalled
     * proxy objects, this method will throw an exception of type
     * LookupUnmarshalException.

     * useful information: (1) the knowledge that a problem has occurred
     * while unmarshalling at least one of the elements making up the
     * remote state of this registration's discovered lookup service(s),
     * (2) the set consisting of the proxy objects that were successfully
     * unmarshalled by this method, (3) the set consisting of the marshalled
     * proxy objects that could not be unmarshalled by this method, and
     * (4) the set of exceptions corresponding to each failed attempt at
     * unmarshalling.
     * <p>
     * Typically, the type of exception that occurs when attempting to
     * unmarshal an element of the set of marshalled proxies is either an
     * IOException or a ClassNotFoundException. A ClassNotFoundException 
     * occurs whenever a remote field of the marshalled proxy cannot be
     * retrieved (usually because the codebase of one of the field's classes
     * or interfaces is currently 'down'). To address this situation, the
     * client may wish to proceed with its processing using the successfully
     * unmarshalled proxies; and attempt to unmarshal the unavailable proxies
     * (or re-invoke this method) at some later time.
     * <p>
     * Note that if this method returns successfully without throwing a
     * LookupUnmarshalException, the client is guaranteed that all
     * marshalled proxies returned to this method by the lookup discovery
     * service have been successfully unmarshalled; and the client then
     * has a snapshot - relative to the point in time when this method
     * is invoked - of the remote state of the lookup service(s) discovered
     * for this registration.

    /** The constrainable version of <code>FiddlerRegistration</code>. 
     *  <p>
     *  When a client obtains an instance of this proxy class, the client
     *  should not attempt to use the proxy until the client is assured
     *  that the proxy can be trusted. In addition to implementing the
     *  methods and mechanisms required by <code>RemoteMethodControl</code>, 
     *  this class - in conjunction with the service's
     *  <code>ProxyVerifier</code> class, helps provide a mechanism
     *  for verifying trust in the proxy on behalf of a client.
     *  <p>
     *  In order to verify that an instance of this class is trusted, 
     *  trust must be verified in all subsidiary objects (contained in that
     *  instance) through which the client ultimately makes calls (local or
     *  remote).  With respect to this class, the <code>server</code> field
     *  (which will be referred to as 'server1' for this description) is
     *  a proxy object through which the client makes remote calls to the 
     *  service's backend. Therefore, trust in that object must be
     *  verified.
     *  <p>
     *  In addition to server1, this class also contains a field of
     *  type <code>Uuid</code> (<code>registrationID</code>), and a
     *  field of type <code>EventRegistration</code> (the field 
     *  <code>eventReg</code>). Therefore, as with server1, trust must
     *  also be verified in each of these objects.
     *  <p>
     *  As indicated by the pattern described above, in order to verify
     *  trust in the subsidiary objects of this class, trust must also be
     *  verified in any subsidiary objects those objects themselves
     *  contain; and so on, until all subsidiary objects have been 
     *  exhausted. The <code>eventReg</code> field contains such subsidiary
     *  objects that also contain subsidiary objects, each requiring 
     *  verification. Those subsidiary objects are: a field of type
     *  <code>ConstrainableFiddlerProxy</code> (named <code>source</code>),
     *  and a field of type <code>ConstrainableFiddlerLease</code>
     *  (the field named <code>lease</code>, referred to below as 'lease1').
     *  <p>
     *  As with this class, the <code>source</code> field of
     *  <code>eventReg</code> is also an "outer proxy" to the service's
     *  backend, and thus also contains an (inner) proxy object (referred
     *  to below as 'server2') through which remote calls are made to the
     *  service's backend; thus, server2 must be verified. And since
     *  the <code>lease</code> field of <code>eventReg</code> also contains
     *  an (inner) proxy object ('server3'), that subsidiary object must
     *  be verified as well.
     *  <p>
     *  The description above is summarized in the following diagram:
     *  <p>
     *  <pre>
     *    FiddlerRegistration {
     *        Fiddler server1
     *        Uuid registrationID
     *        EventRegistration eventReg {
     *            ConstrainableFiddlerProxy source {
     *                Fiddler server2
     *            }//end source
     *            ConstrainableFiddlerLease lease {
     *                Fiddler server3
     *            }//end lease
     *        }//end eventReg
     *    }//end FiddlerRegistration
     *  </pre>
     *  <p>
     *  Thus, in order to verify that an instance of this class is trusted,
     *  trust must be verified in the following objects from the diagram
     *  above:
     *  <ul><li> server1
     *      <li> registrationID
     *      <li> eventReg
     *        <ul><li> source
     *              <ul><li> server2</ul>
     *            <li> lease
     *              <ul><li> server3</ul>
     *        </ul>
     *  </ul>
     *
     *  When a client obtains an instance of this proxy class, the
     *  deserialization process which delivers the proxy to the client
     *  invokes the <code>readObject</code> method of this class, as well
     *  as the <code>readObject</code> method for each subsidiary object,
     *  as the mechanism "walks" through the serialization graph. For
     *  each object that must be verified, part of that trust verification
     *  process is performed in the various <code>readObject</code> methods,
     *  and the remaining part is performed when the client prepares
     *  the proxy. This class' participation in the trust verification
     *  process can be summarized as follows:
     *  <p>
     *  <ul>
     *    <li> server1
     *      <ul>
     *        <li> readObject
     *          <ul>

     *            <li> verify eventReg is an instance of EventRegistration, but
     *                 NOT a subclass of EventRegistration (if it's a subclass,
     *                 then it's possible that the subclass contains methods
     *                 that override the methods of EventRegistration with
     *                 untrusted, un-constrained implementations)
     *            <li> verify eventReg.source != null
     *            <li> verify eventReg.source is an instance of FiddlerProxy
     *            <li> verify server2 != null (this is done in the readObject()
     *                 of FiddlerProxy)
     *            <li> verify eventReg.lease is an instance of FiddlerLease
