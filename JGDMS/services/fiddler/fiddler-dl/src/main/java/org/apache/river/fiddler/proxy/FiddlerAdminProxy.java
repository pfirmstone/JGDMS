    /** The constrainable version of the class <code>FiddlerAdminProxy</code>. 
     *  <p>
     *  When a client obtains an instance of this proxy class, the client
     *  should not attempt to use the proxy until the client is assured
     *  that the proxy can be trusted. In addition to implementing the
     *  methods and mechanisms required by <code>RemoteMethodControl</code>, 
     *  this class - in conjunction with the service's
     *  <code>ProxyVerifier</code> class, helps provide a mechanism
     *  for verifying trust in the proxy on behalf of a client.
     *  <p>
     *  In order to verify that an instance of this class is trusted, 
     *  trust must be verified in all subsidiary objects (contained in that
     *  instance) through which the client ultimately makes calls (local or
     *  remote).  With respect to this class, the <code>server</code> field
     *  is a proxy object through which the client makes remote calls to the 
     *  service's backend. Therefore, trust in that object must be
     *  verified. Additionally, this class also contains a field of type
     *  <code>Uuid</code> (<code>proxyID</code> which should be
     *  tested for trust. Consider the following diagram:
     *  <p>
     *  <pre>
     *    FiddlerAdminProxy {
     *        Fiddler server
     *        Uuid proxyID
     *    }//end FiddlerAdminProxy
     *  </pre>
     *  <p>
     *  Thus, in order to verify that an instance of this class is trusted,
     *  trust must be verified in the following objects from the diagram
     *  above:
     *  <ul><li> server
     *      <li> proxyID
     *  </ul>
     *
     *  When a client obtains an instance of this proxy class, the
     *  deserialization process which delivers the proxy to the client
     *  invokes the <code>readObject</code> method of this class. Part of
     *  trust verification is performed in the <code>readObject</code> method,
     *  and part is performed when the client prepares the proxy. Thus, this
     *  class' participation in the trust verification process can be
     *  summarized as follows:
     *  <p>
     *  <ul>
     *    <li> server
     *      <ul>
     *        <li> readObject
     *          <ul>
     *            <li> verify server != null
     *            <li> verify server implements RemoteMethodControl
     *            <li> verify server's method constraints are the same
     *                 as those placed on the corresponding public Remote
     *                 methods of its outer proxy class
     *          </ul>
     *        <li> proxy preparation
     *          <ul>
     *            <li> Security.verifyObjectTrust() which calls
     *            <li> ProxyVerifier.isTrustedObject() which calls
     *            <li> canonicalServerObject.checkTrustEquivalence(server)
     *                 (whose implementation is supplied by the particular 
     *                 RMI implementation that was used to export the server)
     *          </ul>
     *      </ul>
