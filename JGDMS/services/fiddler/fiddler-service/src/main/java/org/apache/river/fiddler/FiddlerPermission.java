/** 
 * Special purpose permission class, specific to the
 * Fiddler implementation of the lookup discovery service, that can be used
 * to express the access control policy for that service's backend server
 * when it is exported with a {@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter}. This
 * permission class can be passed to an instance of
 * {@link net.jini.jeri.BasicInvocationDispatcher}, and then used in
 * security policy permission grants.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class contains a name (also referred to as a
 * <i>target name</i>), but no actions list; you either have the named
 * permission or you don't. The convention is that the target name is the
 * <i>non</i>-fully qualified name of the remote method being invoked.
 * Wildcard matches are supported using the syntax specified by
 * {@link AccessPermission}.
 * <p>
 *
 * The target names that can be used with a Fiddler server are specified in
 * the package documentation for {@linkplain org.apache.river.fiddler Fiddler}.
