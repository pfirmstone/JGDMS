/**
 * This class is the server side of an implementation of the lookup
 * discovery service. Multiple client-side proxy classes are used to
 * interact and communicate with this backend server. Those proxy
 * classes are: <code>FiddlerProxy</code> (the proxy for the 
 * <code>LookupDiscoveryService</code> interface which defines how clients
 * register with the lookup discovery service), <code>FiddlerAdminProxy</code>
 * (the proxy for the <code>FiddlerAdmin</code> interface which specifies 
 * the methods through which administration duties such as joining, persistent
 * state logging policy, and shutting down the lookup discovery service can
 * be performed), and <code>FiddlerRegistration</code> (the proxy for the 
 * <code>LookupDiscoveryRegistration</code> interface which defines the
 * methods through which clients can perform duties such as group and
 * locator management, state retrieval, and discarding discovered but
 * unavailable lookup services so they are eligible for re-discovery).
 * <p>
 * It is through the proxies that communicate with this class that clients
 * interact with the lookup discovery service. When a client makes a method
 * invocation on one of the proxies, the proxy makes a corresponding call
 * on the methods specified in the <code>Fiddler</code> interface which
 * are implemented in this class, ultimately executing on the backend server.
 * <p>
 *
 * This implementation of the lookup discovery service employs a number of
 * {@link java.util.logging.Logger}s. The details of each such
 * {@link java.util.logging.Logger} are described
 * <a href="./package-summary.html#fiddlerLoggers">here</a>.
 * <p>
 * The configuration entries supported by this implementation are described
 * <a href="./package-summary.html#fiddlerConfigEntries">here</a>.

         * of the registrar since we don't want to send a discarded event
         * to a regInfo that was never interested in that registrar in the

     * Handler class for the persistent storage facility.
     * <p>
     * At any point during processing in this service, there will exist
     * both a 'snapshot' of the service's state and a set of records
     * detailing each significant change that has occurred to the state
     * since the snapshot was taken. The snapshot information and the
     * incremental change information will be stored in separate files
     * called, respectively, the snapshot file and the log file. Together,
     * these files are used to recover the state of the service after a
     * crash or a network outage (or if the service or its ActivationGroup
     * is un-registered and then re-registered through the Activation Daemon).
     * <p>
     * This class contains the methods that are used to record and recover
     * the snapshot of the service's state; as well as the method used to
     * apply the state changes that were recorded in the log file.
     * <p>
     * When the ReliableLog class is instantiated, a new instance of this
     * class is passed to its constructor so that the methods of this
     * class may be invoked by the methods defined in the ReliableLog.
     * Because this class extends the LogHandler class associated with
     * the ReliableLog class, this class must provide implementations of
     * the abstract methods declared in the LogHandler. Also, some of the
     * methods defined in this class override the methods of the LogHandler
     * in order to customize the handling of snapshot creation and
     * retrieval.
     * <p>
     * Each significant change to the service's state is written to the
     * log file as an individual record (when addLogRecord() is invoked).
     * After the number of records logged exceeds a pre-defined threshold,
     * a snapshot of the state is recorded by invoking -- through the
     * ReliableLog and its LogHandler -- the snapshot() method defined in
     * this class. After the snapshot is taken, the log file is cleared
     * and the incremental log process starts over.
     * <p>
     * The contents of the snapshot file reflect the DATA contained in
     * the fields making up the current state of the service. That data
     * represents many changes -- over time -- to the service's state.
     * On the other hand, each record written to the log file is an object
     * that reflects both the data used and the ACTIONS taken to make one
     * change to the service's state at a particular point in time.
     * <p>
     * During recovery, the state of the service at the time of a crash
     * or outage is re-constructed by first retrieving the 'base' state from
     * the snapshot file; and then modifying that base state according to
     * the records retrieved from the log file. The reconstruction of the
     * base state is achieved by invoking the recover() method defined in
     * this class. The modifications recorded in the log file are then
     * applied to the base state by invoking the applyUpdate() method
     * defined in this class. Both recover() and applyUpdate() are invoked
     * through the ReliableLog and its associated LogHandler.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: The following lines must be added to the service's policy file
     * <pre>
     *     permission java.io.FilePermission "dirname",   "read,write,delete";
     *     permission java.io.FilePermission "dirname/-", "read,write,delete";
     * </pre>
     *     where 'dirname' is the name of the directory path (relative or
     *     absolute) where the snapshot and log file will be maintained.

     * Snapshot-taking thread. 
     * <p>
     * A snapshot is taken when -- after writing a new record to the 
     * log file -- it is determined that the size of the log file has 
     * exceeded a certain threshold. The code which adds the new record 
     * to the log file and which, in turn, decides that a snapshot
     * must be taken is "wrapped" in a writer mutex. That is, synchronization
     * of processing is achieved in this service through a "reader/writer"
     * mutex construct. This construct allows only one writer at any one
     * time; but allows an unlimited number of simultaneous readers as
     * long as no writer has locked the mutex. During steady-state, it is
     * anticipated that far more "read actions" will occur (e.g. discovery
     * events being sent) than "write actions" (e.g. modifying the managed
     * sets). Since the process of taking a snapshot can be time-consuming,
     * if the whole snapshot-taking process occupies that single writer
     * mutex, then a significant number of read actions will be un-necessarily
     * blocked; possibly resulting in an unacceptable degradation in
     * response time. 
     * <p>
     * It is for the above reason that the process of taking a snapshot is
     * performed in a separate thread. The thread waits on the monitor
     * belonging to the snapshotThreadSyncObj instance until it is notified
     * (or "signalled") that a snapshot must be taken. The notification
     * is sent by another thread, created by this service, which determines
     * when the conditions are right for a snapshot. The notification takes
     * the form of an interrupt indicating that the snapshot monitor is
     * available. Although the interrupt is sent while the writer mutex is
     * locked, the act of sending the notification is less time-consuming
     * than the act of taking the snapshot itself. When the thread receives
     * a notification, it awakens and requests a lock on the reader mutex
     * (this is all done in the readerWait() method). Because a reader -- not
     * a writer -- mutex is locked, read-only processes still have access
     * to the system state, so discovery events can be sent and the service's
     * state can be queried; but the reader mutex prevents changes to the
     * state while the snapshot is in progress.  
     * <p>
     * Note that the current snapshot is guaranteed to complete before the
     * next snapshot request is received. This is because even though
     * the act of taking a snapshot can be viewed as a writer process, 
     * the fact that the next snapshot notification will be wrapped in a
     * writer mutex, combined with the fact that a writer mutex can not
     * be locked while a reader mutex is locked, allows the snapshot to
     * be treated as a reader process.

                 * should NOT already exist at startup, is when the service is
                 * being started for the very first time. Thus, when either

                 * time, the service's configuration is consulted for the initial
                 * values of the items below; otherwise, when the service is being
                 * re-started (after a crash for example), the values used for
                 * those items will be the values retrieved above during recovery
                 * of the service's persistent state.

                 * With respect to the non-persistent version of the service, the
                 * values of the items below will always be retrieved at startup.

                 * attempts to recover previously stored state; thus, the flag's
                 * value will never change. Note that this will be true even if a
