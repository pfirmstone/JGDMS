/**
 * The <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class is a helper utility class that
 * any client-like entity can use to "discover" services registered with any
 * number of lookup services of interest. On behalf of such entities, this class
 * maintains - as much as possible - up-to-date state information about both the
 * lookup services the entity wishes to query, and the services the entity
 * wishes to acquire and use. By maintaining current service state information,
 * the entity can implement efficient mechanisms for service access and usage.
 * <p>
 * There are three basic usage patterns for this class. In order of importance
 * and typical usage, those patterns are:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> The entity requests that the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> create
 * a cache (an instance of {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache})
 * which will asynchronously "discover", and locally store, references to
 * services that match criteria defined by the entity; services which are
 * registered with one or more lookup services managed by the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> on behalf of the entity. The cache can
 * be viewed as a set of service references that the entity can access locally
 * as needed through one of the public, non-remote methods provided in the
 * cache's interface. Thus, rather than making costly remote queries of multiple
 * lookup services at the point in time when the entity needs the service, the
 * entity can simply make local queries on the cache for the services that the
 * cache acquired and stored at a prior time. An entity should employ this
 * pattern when the entity must make <i>frequent</i>
 * queries for multiple services. By populating the cache with multiple
 * instances of the desired services, redundancy in the availability of those
 * services can be provided. Thus, if an instance of a service is found to be
 * unavailable when needed, the entity can execute a local query on the cache
 * rather than one or more remote queries on the lookup services to acquire an
 * instance that is available. To employ this pattern, the entity invokes the
 * method  {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#createLookupCache
 *        createLookupCache}.
 * <li> The entity can register with the event mechanism provided by the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. This event mechanism allows the entity
 * to request that it be notified when a service of interest is discovered for
 * the first time, or has encountered a state change such as removal from all
 * lookup services, or attribute set changes. Although interacting with a local
 * cache of services in the way described in the first pattern can be very
 * useful to entities that need frequent access to multiple services, some
 * client-like entities may wish to interact with the cache in a reactive
 * manner. For example, an entity such as a service browser typically wishes to
 * be notified of the arrival of new services of interest as well as any changes
 * in the state of the current services in the cache. In these situations,
 * polling for such changes is usually viewed as undesirable. If the cache were
 * to also provide an event mechanism with notification semantics, the needs of
 * entities that employ either pattern can be satisfied. To employ this pattern,
 * the entity must create a cache and supply it with an instance of the  {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryListener
 *        ServiceDiscoveryListener} interface that will receive instances of
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryEvent ServiceDiscoveryEvent} when
 * events of interest, related to the services in the cache, occur.
 * <li> The entity, through the public API of the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>, can directly query the lookup services
 * managed by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> for services of interest;
 * employing semantics similar to the semantics employed in a typical lookup
 * service query made through the
 * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar} interface.
 * Such queries will result in a remote call being made at the same time the
 * service is needed (unlike the first pattern, in which remote calls typically
 * occur prior to the time the service is needed). This pattern may be useful to
 * entities needing to find services on an infrequent basis, or when the cost of
 * making a remote call is outweighed by the overhead of maintaining a local
 * cache (for example, due to limited resources). Although an entity that needs
 * to query lookup service(s) can certainly make such queries through the
 * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar} interface, the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> provides a broad API with semantics that
 * are richer than the semantics of the
 * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar#lookup lookup} methods provided
 * by the {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar
 *        ServiceRegistrar}. This API encapsulates functionality that many client-like
 * entities may find more useful when managing both the set of desired lookup
 * services, and the service queries made on those lookup services. To employ
 * this pattern, the entity simply instantiates this class with the desired
 * parameters, and then invokes the appropriate version of the
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#lookup lookup} method when the
 * entity wishes to acquire a service that matches desired criteria.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All three mechanisms just described - local queries on the cache, service
 * discovery notification, and remote lookups - employ the same
 * template-matching scheme as that employed in the
 * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar} interface.
 * Additionally, each mechanism allows the entity to supply an object referred
 * to as a <i>filter</i>; an instance of
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceItemFilter ServiceItemFilter}. A filter is a
 * non-remote object that defines additional matching criteria that the
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> applies when searching for the entity's
 * services of interest. Employing a filter is particularly useful to entities
 * that wish to extend the capabilities of the standard template-matching
 * scheme.
 * <p>
 * In addition to (or instead of) employing a filter to apply additional
 * matching criteria to candidate service proxies initially found through
 * template matching, filters can also be used to extend the selection process
 * so that only proxies that are <i>safe</i> to use are returned to the entity.
 * To do this, the entity would use the
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceItemFilter ServiceItemFilter} interface to
 * supply the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> or
 * {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache} with a filter that, when
 * applied to a candidate proxy, performs a set of operations that is referred
 * to as <i>proxy preparation</i>. As described in the documentation for
 * {@link net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer}, proxy preparation typically includes
 * operations such as, verifying trust in the proxy, specifying client
 * constraints, and dynamically granting necessary permissions to the proxy.
 * <p>
 * Note that this utility class is not remote. Clients and services that wish to
 * use this class will create an instance of this class in their own address
 * space to manage the state of discovered services and their associated lookup
 * services locally.

 *
 * This implementation of <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> supports the
 * following configuration entries; where each configuration entry name is
 * associated with the component name
 * <code>net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. Note that the
 * configuration entries specified here are specific to this implementation of
 * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code>. Unless otherwise stated, each entry is
 * retrieved from the configuration only once per instance of this utility,
 * where each such retrieval is performed in the constructor.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that in addition to allowing a client of this utility
 * to request - through the public API - the creation of a cache that is used
 * externally by the client, this utility also creates instances of the cache
 * that are used internally by the utility itself. As such, in addition to the
 * configuration entries that are used only in this utility (and not in any
 * cache), and the configuration entries that are retrieved during the
 * construction of each new cache (and used by only that cache), there are
 * configuration entries specified below that are retrieved once during the
 * construction of this utility, but which are shared with, and used by, the
 * caches that are created.

    /**
     * Constructs an instance of <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> which
     * will, on behalf of the entity that constructs this class, discover and
     * manage a set of lookup services, as well as discover and manage sets of
     * services registered with those lookup services. The entity indicates
     * which lookup services to discover and manage through the parameters input
     * to this constructor.
     * <p>
     * As stated in the class description, this class has three usage patterns:
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     * <li> the entity uses a {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache
     *        LookupCache} to locally store and manage discovered services so that
     * those services can be accessed quickly
     * <li> the entity registers with the event mechanism provided by a
     * {@link net.jini.lookup.LookupCache LookupCache} to be notified when
     * services of interest are discovered
     * <li> the entity uses the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> to perform
     * remote queries of the lookup services, employing richer semantics than
     * that provided through the standard
     * {@link net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistrar ServiceRegistrar} interface
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Although the first two usage patterns emphasize the use of a cache
     * object, that cache is acquired only through an instance of the
     * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class.
     * <p>
     * It is important to note that some of the methods of this class      ({@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#createLookupCache
     * createLookupCache} and the <i>blocking</i> versions of
     * {@link net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager#lookup lookup} to be
     * exact) can throw a {@link java.rmi.RemoteException} when invoked. This is
     * because each of these methods may attempt to register with the event
     * mechanism of at least one lookup service, a process that requires a
     * remote object (a listener) to be exported to the lookup service(s). Both
     * the process of registering with a lookup service's event mechanism and
     * the process of exporting a remote object are processes that can result in
     * a {@link java.rmi.RemoteException}.
     * <p>
     * In order to facilitate the exportation of the remote listener just
     * described, the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> class instantiates an
     * inner class that implements the
     * {@link net.jini.core.event.RemoteEventListener RemoteEventListener}
     * interface. Although this class defines, instantiates, and exports this
     * remote listener, <i>it is the entity's responsibility</i> to provide a
     * mechanism for any lookup service to acquire the proxy to the exported
     * listener. One way to do this is to configure this utility to export the
     * listener using the Jini(TM) Extensible Remote Invocation (Jini ERI)
     * communication framework. When the listener is exported to use Jini ERI,
     * and no proxy customizations (such as a custom invocation handler or
     * transport endpoint) are used, no other action is necessary to make the
     * proxy to the listener available to the lookup service(s) with which that
     * listener is registered.
     * <p>
     * The <a href="#eventListenerExporter">default exporter</a> for this
     * utility will export the remote event listener under Jini ERI, specifying
     * that the port and object ID with which the listener is to be exported
     * should be chosen by the Jini ERI framework, not the deployer.
     * <p>
     * If it is required that the remote event listener be exported under JRMP
     * instead of Jini ERI, then the entity that employs this utility must
     * specify this in its configuration. For example, the entity's
     * configuration would need to contain something like the following:
     * <p>
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     * import net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter;
     *
     * application.configuration.component.name {
     *    .......
     *    .......
     *    // configuration items specific to the application
     *    .......
     *    .......
     * }//end application.configuration.component.name
     *
     * net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager {
     *
     *    serverExporter = new JrmpExporter();
     *
     * }//end net.jini.lookup.ServiceDiscoveryManager
     * </pre>
     * </blockquote>
     * <p>
     * It is important to note that when the remote event listener is exported
     * under JRMP, unlike Jini ERI, the JRMP remote communication framework does
     * <b><i>not</i></b> provide a mechanism that automatically makes the
     * listener proxy available to the lookup service(s) with which the listener
     * is registered; the deployer of the entity, or the entity itself, must
     * provide such a mechanism.
     * <p>
     * When exported under JRMP, one of the more common mechanisms for making
     * the listener proxy available to the lookup service(s) with which the
     * listener is registered consists of the following:
     * <p>
     * <ul><li> store the necessary class files in a JAR file
     * <li> make the class files in the JAR file <i>preferred</i>
     * (see package <code>net.jini.loader.pref </code> for details)
     * <li> run an HTTP server to serve up the JAR file to any requesting lookup
     * service
     * <li> advertise the location of that JAR file by setting the
     * <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property of the entity to "point"
     * at the JAR file
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * For example, suppose an application consists of an entity that intends to
     * use the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> will run on a host named
     * <b><i>myHost</i></b>. And suppose that the <i>down-loadable</i> JAR file
     * named <b><i>sdm-dl.jar</i></b> that is provided in the distribution is
     * located in the directory <b><i>/files/jini/lib</i></b>, and will be
     * served by an HTTP server listening on port
     * <b><i>8082</i></b>. If the application is run with its codebase property
     * set to
     * <code>-Djava.rmi.server.codebase="http://myHost:8082/sdm-dl.jar"</code>,
     * the lookup service(s) should then be able to access the remote listener
     * exported under JRMP by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> on behalf
     * of the entity.
     * <p>
     * If a mechanism for lookup services to access the remote listener exported
     * by the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> is not provided (either by
     * the remote communication framework itself, or by some other means), the
     * remote methods of the <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> - the methods
     * involved in the two most important usage patterns of that utility - will
     * be of no use.
     * <p>
     * This constructor takes two arguments: an object that implements the
     * <code>DiscoveryManagement</code> interface and a reference to a
     * <code>LeaseRenewalManager</code> object. The constructor throws an
     * <code>IOException</code> because construction of a
     * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> may initiate the multicast discovery
     * process, a process that can throw an <code>IOException</code>.
     *
     * @param discoveryMgr the <code>DiscoveryManagement</code> implementation
     * through which notifications that indicate a lookup service has been
     * discovered or discarded will be received. If the value of the argument is

     * Queries each available lookup service in the managed set for service(s)

     * <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> interface; employing the same
     * template-matching scheme. Additionally, this method allows any entity to
     * supply an object referred to as a <i>filter</i>. Such an object is a
     * non-remote object that defines additional matching criteria that the
     * <code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> applies when searching for the
     * entity's services of interest. This filtering facility is particularly
     * useful to entities that wish to extend the capabilities of standard
     * template-matching.
     * <p>
     * Entities typically employ this method when they need infrequent access to
     * multiple instances of services, and when the cost of making remote
     * queries is outweighed by the overhead of maintaining a local cache (for
     * example, because of resource limitations).
     * <p>
     * This version of <code>lookup</code> returns an <i>array</i> of instances
     * of <code>ServiceItem</code> in which each element corresponds to a
     * service reference that satisfies the matching criteria. The number of
     * elements in the returned set will be no greater than the value of the
     * <code>maxMatches</code> parameter, but may be less.
     * <p>
     * Note that this version of <code>lookup</code> does not provide a
     * <i>blocking</i> feature. That is, this version will return immediately
     * with whatever number of service references it can find, up to the number
     * indicated in the <code>maxMatches</code> parameter. If no services
     * matching the input criteria can be found on the first attempt, an empty
     * array is returned.
     *
     * It is important to understand this characteristic because there is a
     * common usage scenario that can cause confusion when this version of
     * <code>lookup</code> is used but fails to discover any instances of the
     * expected service of interest. Suppose an entity creates a service
     * discovery manager and then immediately calls this version of
     * <code>lookup</code>, which simply queries the currently discovered lookup
     * services for the service of interest. If the discovery manager employed
     * by the service discovery manager has not yet discovered any lookup
     * services (thus, there are no lookup services to query) the method will
     * immediately return an empty array. This can be confusing when one
     * verifies that instance(s) of such a service of interest have indeed been
     * started and registered with the existing lookup service(s). To address
     * this issue, one of the blocking versions of <code>lookup</code> could be
     * used instead of this version, or the entity could simply wait until the
     * discovery manager has been given enough time to complete its own (lookup)
     * discovery processing.
