/**
 * A goal of any well-behaved service is to advertise the facilities and
 * functions it provides by requesting residency within at least one lookup
 * service. Making such a request of a lookup service is known as registering
 * with, or <i>joining</i>, a lookup service. To demonstrate this good
 * behavior, a service must comply with both the multicast discovery protocol
 * and the unicast discovery protocol in order to discover the lookup services
 * it is interested in joining. The service must also comply with the join
 * protocol to register with the desired lookup services. 
 * <p>
 * In order for a service to maintain its residency in the lookup services
 * it has joined, the service must provide for the coordination, systematic
 * renewal, and overall management of all leases on that residency. In
 * addition to handling all discovery and join duties, as well as managing
 * all leases on lookup service residency, the service must also provide
 * for the coordination and management of any attribute sets with which
 * it may have registered with the lookup services in which it resides.
 * <p>
 * This class performs all of the functions related to discovery, joining,
 * service lease renewal, and attribute management which is required of a
 * well-behaved service. Each of these activities is intimately involved
 * with the maintenance of a service's residency in one or more lookup
 * services (the service's join state), thus the name <code>JoinManager</code>.
 * <p>
 * This class should be employed by services, not clients. The use of this
 * class in a wide variety of services can help minimize the work resulting
 * from having to repeatedly implement this required functionality in each
 * service. Note that this class is not remote. Services that wish to use
 * this class will create an instance of this class in the service's address
 * space to manage the entity's join state locally.

public class JoinManager {
    
    /** Implementation Note:
     *
     *  This class executes a number of tasks asynchronously. Each task is
     *  initially queued in a <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code>
     *  instance, which executes each task in a separate thread. In this
     *  way, an upper bound is placed on the number of threads executing
     *  concurrently at any one time; that is, the number of concurrent
     *  threads is "throttled".
     *
     *  In addition to throttling the number of concurrent threads, the
     *  use of an ExecutorService, in conjunction with the task configuration,
     *  provides a level of resiliency with respect to down/unresponsive
     *  lookup services.
     *
     *  Recall from the specification that the primary function of a join
     *  manager is to maintain and update the state (registrations,
     *  attribute augmentations/replacements/changes, etc.) of the join
     *  manager's single associated service with all of the desired lookup
     *  services. Because updating a service's state in a lookup service
     *  involves remote communication, such update operations are performed
     *  asynchronously, in separate tasks. If those operations are not
     *  performed in separate tasks, then a communication problem with
     *  one of the lookup services while performing one operation could
     *  prevent (or significantly slow) the execution of all future
     *  state update operations; causing all processing in the join manager
     *  to degrade or even hang indefinitely.
     *
     *  Although performing each update operation in a separate task thread
     *  prevents a down/unresponsive lookup service from blocking other
     *  processing in the join manager, it does not guarantee consistency
     *  of the service's state in each "up" lookup service, with the state
     *  expected by the client that requested the state changes.
     *
     *  For example, suppose the client first requests that the service's
     *  attributes be replaced with a new set, and then immediately after
     *  the attribute replacement request, the client requests that the
     *  service's attributes be augmented by yet another set of attributes.
     *  Unless control is imposed on the order of execution of the tasks
     *  that perform the attribute replacement and augmentation, there is
     *  a possibility that the service's state in one or more of the lookup
     *  service's will have experienced the attribute augmentation prior to
     *  the attribute replacement, rather than the replacement followed by
     *  the augmentation, as the client would have expected. Thus, not only
     *  can the service's state in one or more of the lookup services be
     *  inconsistent with what the client expects, but it can also be
     *  inconsistent with one or more of the other lookup services with
     *  which the service is registered.
     *  
     *  To prevent the possibility of inconsistencies such as those just
     *  described, the state update operations are grouped according to
     *  the particular lookup service with which they are associated. Each
     *  such grouping is implemented as a task, executed by the task
     *  manager employed by this implementation of <code>JoinManager</code>,
     *  containing a queue of sub-tasks (the actual state update operations)
     *  that are executed by the main task in the same order in which they
     *  were requested by the client.
     *  
     *  Each main task executed by this join manager's ExecutorService is a
     *  sub-class of the abstract class <code>RetryTask</code>, defined in
     *  the package <code>org.apache.river.thread</code>, which implements
     *  the <code>org.apache.river.thread.TaskManager.Task</code> interface.
     *  The association of each such task with a particular lookup service,
     *  and with a unique sequence number is reflected in the fields of this
     *  class. The unique sequence number associated with each main task
     *  is exploited by the <code>runAfter</code> method defined in 
     *  <code>RetryTask</code> to guarantee that the service managed by
     *  this <code>JoinManager</code> is assigned only one service ID.
     *   
     *  Because of the relationship between the main tasks and 
     *  <code>RetryTask</code>, those concrete main tasks created in this
     *  implementation of <code>JoinManager</code> can be processed by either
     *  an ExecutorService or a wakeup manager; and this fact is exploited to
     *  provide a failure recovery mechanism that can tolerate task "storms".
     *  Task storms can occur in systems that contain numerous services,
     *  where each service employs its own join manager to handle its join
     *  state with the desired lookup services. A "registration request storm"
     *  is an example of one type of task storm.
     *
     *  A registration request storm can occur when a system is initially
     *  started, or when it recovers from a system-wide failure, when each
     *  service's join manager attempts to register with each discovered
     *  lookup service; resulting in a flood - or "storm" - of registration
     *  requests at each lookup service. Because the accept queue under some
     *  operating systems is - by default - very small, it is possible that,
     *  in the face of such a large number of concurrent requests, one or
     *  more of the lookup services will not be able to process the requests
     *  as fast as they are arriving in the queue. When this happens, the
     *  associated task in the join manager typically encounters a failure
     *  such as a <code>java.rmi.ConnectException</code>.
     *
     *  To deal with situations such as that described above, this
     *  <code>JoinManager</code> implementation employs a wakeup manager
     *  in addition to an ExecutorService. When a main task is created, it is
     *  initially executed by an ExecutorService. If a failure is encountered,
     *  and if the nature of that failure indicates that retrying the task
     *  will <i>definitely</i> fail again, then the associated lookup service
     *  is discarded so that the task can be retried when the lookup service
     *  is rediscovered. But if it is not clear that retrying the task will
     *  again fail, (that is, the failure is <i>indefinite</i>), then the
     *  task is queued for re-execution at a later time in a wakeup manager.
     *  This process is repeated - employing a "backoff" strategy - until one
     *  of the following events occurs:
     *
     *  <p><ul>
     *     <li> the task succeeds 
     *     <li> a definite failure is encountered
     *     <li> the task has been executed the maximum number times allowed 
     *  </ul><p>
     *  
     *  The maximum number of times a task is allowed to be retried before
     *  giving up and discarding the associated lookup service can be changed
     *  from its default value by setting the <code>wakeupRetries</code>
     *  configuration entry for this component.

     *  of lookup service discard event, there is one type of discard
     *  that this task is actually intended to address: the so-called
     *  "lost-interest" discard. A discard corresponding to a loss of
     *  interest is an indication that the discarded lookup service is
     *  still up and available, but the discovery manager employed by
     *  this join manager (not the join manager or the service itself)
     *  discards the lookup service because the service is no longer
     *  interested in being registered with that lookup service. This
     *  loss of interest is caused by a change in either the lookup
     *  service's member groups or the service's groups-to-discover.
     *  Such a change in groups would typically be made administratively,
     *  through either the lookup service's administrative interface or
     *  through the service's administrative interface (or both). 
     *
     *  When the lookup service is discarded because of a loss of
     *  interest, there is a time period in which the service is still
     *  registered with the lookup service, even though the service no
     *  longer wishes to be registered with that lookup service. To 
     *  address this, the lease is cancelled so that the service is
     *  removed from the lookup service in a much more timely fashion
     *  than simply allowing the lease to expire.
     *
     *  As stated above, this task is also executed upon receipt of
     *  the other types of discard event. But because those other
     *  discard types occur when the lookup service is no longer
     *  available, the lease cancellation that is attempted here has
     *  no significant effect.

         *  lease granted to this join manager's associated service by the
         *  lookup service referenced in the proxy object associated with
         *  this class (<code>ProxyReg</code>).
         *
         *  If the lease expires in the lookup service before the lease 
         *  renewal manager requests renewal of the lease, then upon sending
         *  that renewal request, the lease renewal manager will receive an
         *  <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> from the lookup service.
         *  As a result, the lease renewal manager removes the expired lease
         *  so that no further renewal attempts are made for that lease, 
         *  and then sends to this listener a <code>LeaseRenewalEvent</code>,
         *  containing an <code>UnknownLeaseException</code>.
         *
         *  Alternatively, suppose that at the time the lease renewal manager
         *  is about to request the renewal of the lease, the lease renewal
         *  manager determines that the expiration time of the lease has
         *  actually passed. In this case, since there is no reason to
         *  send the renewal request, the lease renewal manager instead
         *  removes the expired lease (again, so that no further renewal
         *  attempts are made for that lease), and then sends a
         *  <code>LeaseRenewalEvent</code> to this listener to indicate
         *  that the lease has expired. The difference between this case,
         *  and the case described previously is that in this case the
         *  <code>LeaseRenewalEvent</code> contains no exception (that is,
         *  <code>LeaseRenewalEvent.getException</code> returns 
         *  <code>null</code>).
         *
         *  Both situations described above indicate that the lease
         *  referenced by the event received by this listener has expired.
         *  Thus, the normal course of action should be to attempt to
         *  re-register the service with the lookup service that originally
         *  granted the lease that has expired.
         *
         *  Prior to re-registering the service, the joinSet is examined to
         *  determine if it contains a ProxyReg object that is equivalent to
         *  the ProxyReg object referencing the current instance of this
         *  listener class. That is, using <code>equals</code>, it is
         *  determined whether the joinSet contains either ProxyReg.this,
         *  or a new instance of ProxyReg that is equal to ProxyReg.this.
         *  If the joinSet does not contain such a ProxyReg, then the lookup
         *  service must have been discarded and not yet re-discovered; in
         *  which case, there is no need to attempt to re-register with that
         *  lookup service, since it is unavailable.
         *
         *  If it is determined that the joinSet does contain either
         *  ProxyReg.this or a new ProxyReg equivalent to ProxyReg.this,
         *  then re-registration should be attempted, but only if the lease
         *  associated with the ProxyReg in the joinSet is equal to the
         *  expired lease referenced in the event received by this listener.
         *  Equality of those leases is an indication that the lease on the
         *  service's current registration has expired; thus, an attempt to
         *  re-register the service should be made.
         *
         *  If the lease associated with the ProxyReg from the joinSet
         *  does not equal the expired lease from the event, then
         *  re-registration should not be attempted. This is because
         *  the inequality of the leases is an indication that the lease
         *  renewal event received by this listener was the result of an
         *  <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> that occurs when the
         *  ProxyReg in the joinSet is a new ProxyReg, different from
         *  ProxyReg.this, and the lease renewal manager requests the
         *  renewal of the (now invalid) lease associated with that old
         *  ProxyReg.this; not the valid lease associated with the new
         *  ProxyReg.
         *
         *  A scenario such as that just described can occur when the
         *  lookup service is discarded, rediscovered, and the service is
         *  re-registered, resulting in a new ProxyReg (with new lease)
         *  being placed in the joinSet, replacing the previous ProxyReg
         *  (ProxyReg.this). But before the old, expired lease is removed
         *  from the lease renewal manager, an attempt to renew the old
         *  lease is made. Such an attempt can occur because the lease
         *  renewal manager may be in the process of requesting the renewal
         *  of that lease (or may have queued such a request) just prior to,
         *  or at the same time as, when the lease removal request is made
         *  during discard processing. When the request is made to renew
         *  the expired lease, an <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> occurs
         *  and a lease renewal event is sent to this listener.
         *
         *  If, upon receiving an event such as that just described, the
         *  service were to be re-registered, the current valid service
         *  registration would be replaced, a new lease would be granted,
         *  and the corresponding ProxyReg currently contained in the joinSet
         *  would be replaced with a new ProxyReg. Additionally, the now
         *  invalid lease corresponding to the ProxyReg that was just
         *  replaced would remain in the lease renewal manager. This means
         *  that an attempt to renew that lease will eventually be made and
         *  will fail, and the cycle just described will repeat indefinitely.
         *
         *  Thus, for the reasons stated above, re-registration is attempted
         *  only if the lease associated with the ProxyReg contained in the
         *  joinSet is equal to the expired lease referenced in the lease
         *  renewal event received by this listener.
