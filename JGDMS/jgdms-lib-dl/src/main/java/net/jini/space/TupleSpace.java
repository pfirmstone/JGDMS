    /**
     * Register for events triggered when a matching {@link Entry}
     * transitions from unavailable to available.  The resulting
     * events will be instances of the {@link AvailabilityEvent}
     * class and the {@link AvailabilityEvent#getEntry
     * AvailabilityEvent.getEntry} method will return a copy of
     * the <code>Entry</code> whose transition triggered the
     * event.<p>
     *
     * An <code>Entry</code> makes a transition from
     * <em>unavailable to available</em> when it goes from being in
     * a state where it could not be returned by a {@link
     * TupleSpace#take TupleSpace.take} using <code>txn</code> to a
     * state where it could be returned. An <code>Entry</code>
     * makes a transition from <em>invisible to visible</em> when
     * it goes from being in a state where it could not be returned
     * by a {@link TupleSpace#read TupleSpace.read} using
     * <code>txn</code> to a state where it could be
     * returned. Note, any transition from invisible to visible is
     * also a transition from unavailable to available, but an
     * already visible entry can be unavailable and then make a
     * transition from unavailable to available. Because the entry
     * was already visible, this transition would not be a
     * transition from invisible to visible.<p>
     *
     * The <code>tmpls</code> parameter must be a {@link
     * Collection} of <code>Entry</code> instances to be used as
     * templates. Events will be generated when an
     * <code>Entry</code> that matches one or more of these
     * templates makes an appropriate transition. A single
     * transition will generate only one event per registration, in
     * particular the transition of an <code>Entry</code> that
     * matches multiple elements of <code>tmpls</code> must still
     * generate exactly one event for this registration. If a given
     * <code>Entry</code> undergoes multiple applicable transitions
     * while the registration is active, each must generate a
     * separate event.<p>
     * 
     * Events are not generated directly by the transition of
     * matching entries, but instead by an abstract observer set up
     * in the space for each registration. The observer may see the
     * transitions out of order and as a result the order of the
     * events generated for this registration (as determined by the
     * sequence numbers assigned to the events) may be different
     * from the order of the transitions themselves. Additionally,
     * each registration will have its own abstract observer and
     * different observers may see the same sequence of transitions
     * in different orders. As a result, given a set of transitions
     * that trigger events for two different registrations, the
     * order of the events generated for one registration may
     * differ from the order of the events generated for the
     * other. <p>
     *
     * A non-<code>null</code> {@link EventRegistration} object
     * will be returned.  Each registration will be assigned an
     * event ID. The event ID will be unique at least with respect
     * to all other active event registrations for
     * <code>AvailabilityEvent</code>s on this space with a
     * non-equivalent set of templates, a different transaction,
     * and/or a different value for the
     * <code>visibilityOnly</code> flag. The event ID can be
     * obtained by calling the {@link EventRegistration#getID
     * EventRegistration.getID} method on the returned
     * <code>EventRegistration</code>. The returned
     * <code>EventRegistration</code> object's {@link
     * EventRegistration#getSource EventRegistration.getSource}
     * method will return a reference to the space.<p>
     * 
     * Registrations are leased. <code>leaseDurations</code>
     * represents the client's desired initial lease duration.  If
     * <code>leaseDuration</code> is positive, the initial lease
     * duration will be a positive value less than or equal to
     * <code>leaseDuration</code>. If <code>leaseDuration</code> is
     * {@link Lease#ANY Lease.ANY}, the space is free to pick any
     * positive initial lease duration it desires. A proxy for the
     * lease associated with the registration can be obtained by
     * calling the returned <code>EventRegistration</code>'s {@link
     * EventRegistration#getLease EventRegistration.getLease}
     * method.<p>
     *
     * A registration made with a non-<code>null</code> value for
     * <code>txn</code> is implicitly dropped when the space
     * observes <code>txn</code> has left the active state.<p>

     *              generated by the transitions of entries
