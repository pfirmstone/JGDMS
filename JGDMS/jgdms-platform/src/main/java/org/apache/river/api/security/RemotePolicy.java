/**
 * <p>
 * RemotePolicy is a service api that can be implemented by a distributed Policy service, 
 * allowing local Policy providers to be updated remotely by a djinn group administrator.
 * </p><p>
 * No service implementation has been provided, RemotePolicyProvider
 * implements this interface to simplify creation of such a service.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Notes for implementors:</h2>
 * <p>
 * For security purposes, only secure jeri Endpoint's should be used and must
 * require client and server authentication, in addition the proxy must be a 
 * reflective proxy only, as DownloadPermission should not be granted, which is 
 * also beneficial to reduce network load on the administrator client.  
 * RemotePolicy may be submitted to a lookup service, where an administrator 
 * client will respond to a ServiceEvent notification, thereby providing the
 * RemotePolicy service node, with the permissions requried to participate in 
 * the djinn, an administrator client will also periodically update policy in
 * the djinn.
 * </p><p>
 * To reduce network load, the administrator client may delay updates by
 * lazily processing updates in a serial manner.  New RemotePolicy services
 * obtained by the administrator client's via RemoteEvent notification should
 * be processed as a priority over policy updates.  Eventually a djinn group
 * policy should reach equilibrium where all nodes have had their policy's 
 * updated.
 * </p><p>
 * This policy, in addition to any local policy provider, allows a network djinn
 * administrator to provide a list of PermissionGrant's, from a single or 
 * replicated remote location,  distributed to all nodes in a djinn.
 * </p><p>
 * Multiple RemotePolicy's may be in force on a single JVM instance,
 * each nested policy service instance may be responsible for updating policy for each
 * djinn or group a JVM node joins.
 * </p><p>
 * RemotePolicy provides a means to dynamically grant permissions required 
 * by other services provided by the djinn or client Subjects accessing
 * services provided by the djinn. 
 * The JVM that receives policy in the form of PermissionGrant's should limit
 * the GrantPermission's granted to a djinn administrator, especially if that
 * administrator is from another organisation.
 * </p><p>
 * In addition, replicating administrator clients may register a pseudo RemotePolicy
 * in order to track the primary administrator client and take over in the
 * event it fails.  Failure may be failure to authenticate or failure to renew
 * a Lease.
 * </p><p>
 * RemotePolicy, if it encapsulates an underlying RemotePolicy, does not
 * delegate updates to the base RemotePolicy, this is in case an
 * implementer wants a number of different layers of RemotePolicy, where
 * each layer represents a different administrator role or responsibility.  
 * The administrator's subject must hold the necessary permissions in order
 * to grant them, including GrantPermission and PolicyPermission("REMOTE").
 * </p><p>
 * A node may join more than one djinn group, in this case RemotePolicy's may
 * be used as nested basePolicy's.
 * </p><p>
 * The intent of RemotePolicy is for granting of DowloadPermission to
 * new signer Certificates and adding new Principals and Permission's to
 * distributed policy providers.
 * </p><p>
 * Local policy files should be used to restrict the Permissions grantable
 * via a RemotePolicy.
 * </p><p>
 * PermissionGrant's that are replaced and no longer exist in the RemotePolicy
 * will no longer be implied by the policy.
 * </p><p>
 * DefaultPolicyParser has been provided for an administrator client to
 * parse standard java format policy file's, to create PermissionGrant's.
