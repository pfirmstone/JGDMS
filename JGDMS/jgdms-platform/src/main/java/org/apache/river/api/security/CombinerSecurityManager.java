/**
 * CombinerSecurityManager, is intended to be a highly scalable
 * SecurityManager implementation that caches the results of security checks
 * for each context, which may be an instance of SecurityContext or
 * AccessControlContext.  Stale records are pruned from the cache.
 * 
 * The cache utilises Cliff Click's NonBlockingHashMap and Doug Lee's 
 * ConcurrentSkipListSet.
 * 
 * This SecurityManager should be tuned for garbage collection for a large
 * young generation heap, since many young objects are created and discarded.
 * 
 * It is recommended that this SecurityManager be installed from the command
 * line in order to load as early as possible.
 * 
 * Apart from Permission objects and java.security.Policy.getPolicy() class
 * lock (Bug ID: 7093090 fixed in jdk8(b15), this SecurityManager is non
 * blocking, including the cache it keeps to prevent repeat security checks.
 * 
 * @see Security
 * @see SecurityContext
 * @see AccessControlContext
