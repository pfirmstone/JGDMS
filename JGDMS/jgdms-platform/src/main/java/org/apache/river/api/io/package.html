        <title>Atomic Serialization</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Atomic serialization is designed to allow users to perform
            de-serialization of untrusted data, {@literal @}AtomicSerial
            is a Public API designed to support any serialization
            framework, that provides access to Object data for serialization
            and the ability to re-create objects during de-serializtaion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intent of {@literal @}AtomicSerial is to allow extensiblity of
            serialization frameworks to support Services written in different
            languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            {@literal @}AtomicSerial is a public API, which means that methods
            and classes are public.  There are two reasons for this:
        </p>  
        <ol>
          <li>Constructors and methods need visibility to avoid breaking in modular environments.</li>
          <li>Java Serialization makes internal Object state public.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion of example</h2>
        <p>Notice the annotation {@literal @}AtomicSerial? this indicates the class has a
            constructor that accepts a single GetArg argument.  Implementing
            {@literal @}AtomicSerial is actually very simple, and in most cases only
            requires the addition of a constructor.  Valid provides utility
            methods to simplify validation of invariants, in this case the List
            is being defensively copied into a new LinkedList and all elements
            are type checked, ensuring they are instances of Item.   You may
            have also noticed that GetArg.get(String name, T default, Class type)
            performs type checking.</p>
        <p>In case you're wondering why type checking is necessary, java
            Generic's only perform type checks at compile time, an attacker
            could send you a Collection containing an object you're not
            expecting, so it's important to validate the contents of your
            collections during construction.</p>
        <p>It is a requirement of {@literal @}AtomicSerial that all invariant checks
            are performed before calling a superclass constructor, this
            guarantees an instance of your object will not be created if
            invariants are not satisfied, thus an attacker cannot obtain
            an instance using a finalizer or stream reference.  GetArg is caller
            sensitive, so you can pass it to a superclass constructor, 
            the superclass and extending child class cannot get at each other's
            fields and they may even use the same field names without conflict,
            because each class has its own field namespace.</p>
        <p>Note that the Item class above also implements {@literal @}AtomicSerial, it too
            performs invariant validation.  In fact, the administrator can use
            the java security policy to control which codebases may be involved 
            in deserialization, by granting permission 
            org.apache.river.api.io.DeSerializationPermission "ATOMIC";  
            Serializable Object's that only have primitive fields, or are 
            stateless, don't need to implement {@literal @}AtomicSerial and are not 
            controlled by DeSerializationPermission at this time.</p>
        <p>There's also a lot more going on under the hood, the developer need
            not be too concerned about, for example the above List of items 
            is replaced with a safe List implementation during serialization
            by org.apache.river.api.io.AtomicMarshalOutputStream.
            Because Java Collections cannot be safely deserialized without
            the risk of DOS occurring, Collection, List, Set, SortedSet, Map
            and SortedMap's are all replaced in the stream, so most of the
            hard work is done for you, all you have to do is defensively copy
            during construction, perform type checks and check any other
            invariants you may have.  Valid also provides a lot of other useful
            invariant validation methods a developer might typically perform,
            such as throwing an InvalidObjectException with a message if an
            argument shouldn't be null.</p>
        <p>Unlike standard java serialization, the attacker doesn't have access
            to the full classpath, but a much reduced attack surface; 
            only classes belonging to domains with DeSerializationPermission.
            Attackers are much less likely to be able to create a graph of
            objects with method call chains used for gadget attacks, provided
            scope has been limited by DeSerializationPermission and each object
            checks its own invariants.</p>
        <p>Object's require permission to be created, while invariant checks
            and Java's strong type system limit the possible graph of object
            references an attacker can create.  Circular references are
            prohibited to avoid infinite recursion and limits are placed
            on the serial Object cache and array lengths.  Objects are
            responsible for recreating their own circular reference structures
            during construction if required.</p>
