/**
 * PolicyOnlySecurityManager allows the Principle of Lease Privilege to be used
 * with a security Policy, while retaining scalability and performance.
 * <p>
 * ProtectionDomains created with the two argument constructor are static,
 * they never consult the Policy, however adding static Permission's to a
 * ProtectionDomain, for anything other than AllPermission can have a 
 * significant performance impact.  For this reason 
 * {@link ConcurrentPolicyFile#getPermissions(java.security.CodeSource) }
 * method returns an empty PermissionCollection for anything other than
 * AllPermission, however ClassLoader's call this method to obtain the 
 * static permissions for ProtectionDomain's using a two argument constructor. 
 * This has never been an issue when AllPermission is used for local trusted
 * code, however there are times when we want to limit privileges to the
 * principle of least privilege for local code too.
 * <p>
 * This SecurityManager implementation replaces all ProtectionDomain's with
 * a four argument constructor, so the policy provider will always be
 * consulted.
