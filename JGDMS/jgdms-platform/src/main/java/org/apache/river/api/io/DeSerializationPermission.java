/**
 * Permission that when granted, allows de-serialization of an object.
 * Only the protection domains of each class in an object hierarchy are tested,
 * prior to construction.  Any parameter objects have already been checked.
 * <p>
 * DeSerializationPermission is different to other permissions, where other 
 * Permissions guard something, and all domains on the call stack must have
 * the Permission, DeSerializationPermission is only checked against the 
 * domains representing the class hierarchy of an object about to be 
 * de-serialized.  It is about trusting the classes of the object to check
 * all invariants while reading a stream from an untrusted source.  This also
 * allows a developer to utilize libraries, while minimizing the available
 * classes that can participate in atomic de-serialization.
 * <p>
 * There are only four types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ATOMIC</li>
 * <li>EXTERNALIZABLE</li>
 * <li>MARSHALLED</li>
 * <li>PROXY</li>
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * Permissions should only be granted to domains that are trusted to read in a
 * serial stream from an untrusted data source.
 * <p>
 * No permission is required for stateless objects that implement Serializable.
 * <p>
 * MARSHALLED - MarshalledObject allows any Serialized object to be transferred
 * over a stream, it is often used to compare the serial form of objects, 
 * however because MarshalledObject allows any Serializable class to be 
 * deserialized, it would be unsafe to unmarshal a MarshalledObject instance,
 * so this permission should only be granted for cases where MarshalledObject
 * is not unmarshalled.
