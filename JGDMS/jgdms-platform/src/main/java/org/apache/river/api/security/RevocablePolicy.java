/**
 * <p>
 * RevocablePolicy, is a Java Security Policy Provider that supports
 * Runtime Dynamic addition and removal of PermissionGrant's
 * </p><p>
 * Warning: Not all Permission's are truly revocable, while any Permission can 
 * be dynamically added and later removed from this policy, many JVM Permission
 * implementations are used in ways that allow references to escape
 * </p><p>
 * To quote Tim Blackman, from river-dev:
 * </p><p><CITE>
 * I remember talking with Bob and Mike Warres about this.  The problem with
 * removing permission grants is that when code is granted a permission, 
 * it can very likely squirrel away something -- an object, or another 
 * capability available through the granted permission -- that will permit 
 * it to perform the same operation again without the JVM checking for 
 * the permission again.
 * </CITE>
 * </p><p>
 * In order for a Permission to be fully revoked, the permission must be
 * used to guard methods only, not Objects or their creation.  
 * </p><p>
 * See "Inside Java 2 Platform Security" 2nd Edition, ISBN:0-201-78791-1, page 176.
 * </p><p>
 * A Security Delegate, may be used as a wrapper with an identical interface to the object
 * it protects, a new Permission class must be implemented, for the Delegate's
 * use, in a checkPermission call, to protect access to the underlying
 * object's method. If an existing JVM Permission guards the underlying object,
 * the delegate needs to be given the standard JVM Permission.  DelegatePermission
 * has been created for the purpose of encapsulating an existing Permission.
 * </p><p>
 * The ability to revoke a Permission fully is intended for smart proxy's to
 * be given some trust temporarily, so that objects received from the smart proxy 
 * by a client cannot be used to continue gathering and sending information to
 * a remote server after the proxy has been discarded.
 * </p><p>
 * A list of standard Java Permission's that are confirmed safely 
 * revocable will be provided here.
