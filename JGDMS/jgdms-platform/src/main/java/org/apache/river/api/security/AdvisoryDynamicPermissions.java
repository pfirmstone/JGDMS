/**
 * Jar files that include a META-INF/PERMISSIONS.LIST file,
 * allow a {@link net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer} to grant these permissions dynamically.
 * <p>
 * The PERMISSIONS.LIST file must be UTF-8 encoded, the format of the file 
 * is line based, length is not limited, however lines must be readable by 
 * {@link java.io.BufferedReader#readLine() }.
 * <p>
 * <h2>Syntax:</h2>
 * Comments begin with # or //.
 * <p>
 * A permission is represented by three whitespace delimited strings:
 * <ul>
 * <li>type - The fully qualified class name of the permission. The class must be a subclass
 *        of <code>java.security.Permission</code> and must define a
 *        2-argument constructor that takes a <i>name</i> string and an
 *        <i>actions</i> string.
 * 
 * <li>name - The permission name that will be passed as the first argument
 *        to the constructor of the <code>Permission</code> class identified
 *        by <code>type</code>.
 * 
 * <li>actions - The permission actions that will be passed as the second
 *        argument to the constructor of the <code>Permission</code> class
 *        identified by <code>type</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The encoded format is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * (type)
 * </pre>
 *
 * or
 *
 * <pre>
 * (type &quot;name&quot;)
 * </pre>
 *
 * or
 *
 * <pre>
 * (type &quot;name&quot; &quot;actions&quot;)
 * </pre>
 *
 * where <i>name</i> and <i>actions</i> are strings that must be encoded for
 * proper parsing. Specifically, the <code>&quot;</code>,<code>\</code>,
 * carriage return, and line feed characters must be escaped using
 * <code>\&quot;</code>, <code>\\</code>,<code>\r</code>, and
 * <code>\n</code>, respectively.
 *
 * <p>
 * The encoded string contains no leading or trailing whitespace characters.
 * A single space character is used between <i>type</i> and
 * &quot;<i>name</i>&quot; and between &quot;<i>name</i>&quot; and
 * &quot;<i>actions</i>&quot;.
