/**
 * Interface for classes representing transactions returned by
 * <code>TransactionManager</code> servers for use with transaction
 * participants that implement the default transaction semantics.
 * The semantics: <p>
 *
 * The overall effect of executing a set of sibling pure transactions
 * concurrently is always equivalent to some sequential execution. <p>
 *
 * Ancestor transactions can execute concurrently with child transactions,
 * subject to the locking rules below. <p>
 *
 * Every transactional operation is described in terms of acquiring locks
 * on objects; these locks are held until the transaction completes.  Whatever
 * the lock rules are, conflict rules are defined such that if two operations
 * do not commute, then they acquire conflicting locks.  A transaction can
 * acquire a lock only if the conflicting locks are those held by ancestor
 * transactions (or itself). When a subtransaction commits, its locks are
 * inherited by the parent transaction. <p>
 *
 * If an object is defined to be created under a transaction, then the
 * existence of the object is only visible within that transaction and its
 * inferiors, but will disappear if the transaction aborts.  If an object is
 * defined to be deleted under a transaction, then the object is not visible
 * to any transaction (including the deleting transaction) but will reappear
 * if the transaction aborts.  When a nested transaction commits, visibility
 * state is inherited by the parent transaction. <p>
 *
 * Once a transaction reaches the <code>VOTING</code> stage, if all
 * execution under the transaction (and its subtransactions) has finished,
 * then the only reasons the transaction can abort are: the manager crashes
 * (or has crashed); one or more participants crash (or have crashed); or
 * an explicit abort. <p>
 *
 * Transaction deadlocks are not guaranteed to be prevented or even detected,
 * but managers and participants are permitted to break known deadlocks by
 * aborting transactions. <p>
 *
 * An orphan transaction (it or one of its ancestors is guaranteed to abort)
 * is not guaranteed to be detected. <p>
 *
 * Causal ordering information about transactions is not guaranteed to be
 * propagated. <p>
 *
 * As long as a transaction persists in attempting to acquire a lock that
 * conflicts with another transaction, the participant will persist in
 * attempting to resolve the outcome of the transaction that holds the
 * conflicting lock.
