/**
 * Represents a constraint on authentication of the server to the client.
 * <p>
 * Network authentication by a server (to a client) is implementation-specific,
 * but typically is also scoped and controlled by a <code>Subject</code>. The
 * server subject normally is contained in the
 * {@link net.jini.export.Exporter} used to export that remote
 * object and is taken from the current thread when the exporter is
 * constructed. However, a server might use one subject to control its local
 * execution and a different subject to control its network authentication.
 * A server generally must have permission (such as
 * {@link net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission}) to authenticate itself
 * to clients.
 * <p>
 * It is important to understand that specifying
 * <code>ServerAuthentication.YES</code> as a requirement <i>does not</i>
 * ensure that a server is to be trusted; it <i>does</i> ensure that the
 * server authenticates itself as someone, but it does not ensure that the
 * server authenticates itself as anyone in particular. Without knowing who
 * the server authenticated itself as, there is no basis for actually
 * trusting the server. The client generally needs to specify a
 * {@link ServerMinPrincipal} requirement in addition, or else verify
 * that the server has specified a satisfactory
 * <code>ServerMinPrincipal</code> requirement for each of the methods that
 * the client cares about.
 * <p>
 * Serialization for this class is guaranteed to produce instances that are
 * comparable with <code>==</code>.
