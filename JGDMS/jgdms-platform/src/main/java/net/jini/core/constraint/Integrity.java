/**
 * Represents a constraint on the integrity of message contents, covering not
 * only data transmitted in band as part of the remote call itself, but also
 * out-of-band downloaded code. If an integrity violation on in-band data is
 * detected during a remote call, a {@link java.rmi.RemoteException} will be
 * thrown (in the client or in the server, depending on which side detected
 * the violation). If an integrity violation on out-of-band data is detected,
 * an {@link java.io.IOException} will be thrown at the point where the data
 * is downloaded.
 * <p>
 * Although most of the data for a remote call is transmitted in band as part
 * of the call itself, code is downloaded out of band, based on codebase URLs
 * that are transmitted in band. For a remote call to have integrity, the
 * out-of-band code as well as the in-band data must have integrity. A proxy
 * implementation that provides for integrity must ensure the integrity of
 * both code and data.
 * <p>
 * Code signing is difficult to use for this purpose if the classes span more
 * than a single package (because individual files are signed rather than the
 * entire JAR file being signed, and the only automatic enforcement is that
 * classes in a single package all have the same signers), or if the code
 * references bundled resources (because there is no way to determine the
 * signers of a resource). A better technique is to use codebase URLs that
 * provide content integrity, such as
 * <a href="../../url/httpmd/package-summary.html#package_description">HTTPMD</a>
 * or HTTPS URLs. If integrity-protecting codebase URLs are used, and the URLs
 * themselves are sent as part of the integrity-protected in-band data, the
 * result is complete object integrity. Because out-of-band communication is
 * used, integrity-protecting URLs must either contain sufficient information
 * to independently verify integrity (as is the case with HTTPMD URLs), or
 * must contain sufficient information to authenticate the origin of the
 * content and use sufficient means to maintain content integrity in transit
 * (as is the case with HTTPS URLs).
 * <p>
 * Serialization for this class is guaranteed to produce instances that are
 * comparable with <code>==</code>.
