/**
 * The base class or superclass for remote events.
 * <p>
 * The abstract state contained in a RemoteEvent object includes a reference
 * to the object in which the event occurred, a long which identifies the
 * kind of event relative to the object in which the event occurred, a long
 * which indicates the sequence number of this instance of the event kind,
 * and a MarshalledObject that is to be handed back when the notification
 * occurs.  The combination of the event identifier and the object reference
 * obtained from the RemoteEvent object should uniquely identify the event
 * type.
 * <p>
 * The sequence number obtained from the RemoteEvent object is an increasing
 * value that can act as a hint to the number of occurrences of this event
 * relative to some earlier sequence number.  Any object that generates a
 * RemoteEvent is required to insure that for any two RemoteEvent objects
 * with the same event identifier, the sequence number of those events differ
 * if and only if the RemoteEvent objects are a response to different events.
 * This guarantee is required to allow notification calls to be idempotent.
 * A further guarantee is that if two RemoteEvents, x and y, come from the
 * same source and have the same event identifier, then x occurred before y
 * if and only if the sequence number of x is lower than the sequence number
 * of y.
 * <p>
 * A stronger guarantee is possible for those generators of RemoteEvents
 * that can support it.  This guarantee states that not only do sequence
 * numbers increase, but they are not skipped.  In such a case, if
 * RemoteEvent x and y have the same source and the same event identifier,
 * and x has sequence number m and y has sequence number n, then if m &lt; n 
 * there were exactly n-m-1 events of the same event type between the event 
 * that triggered x and the event that triggered y. Such sequence numbers 
 * are said to be "fully ordered".
 * <p>
 * An event registration that occurs within a transaction is considered to be
 * scoped by that transaction. This means that any occurrence of the kind of
 * event of interest that happens as part of the transaction will cause a
 * notification to be sent to the recipients indicated by the registration
 * that occurred in the transaction.  Such events must have a separate event
 * identifier to allow third-party store and forward entities to distinguish
 * between an event that happens within a transaction and those that happen
 * outside of the transaction.  Notifications of these events will not be
 * sent to entities that registered interest in this kind of event outside
 * the scope of the transaction until and unless the transaction is committed.
 * <p>
 * Because of this, notifications sent from inside a transaction will have a
 * different sequence number than the notifications of the same events would
 * have outside of the transaction.  Within a transaction, all RemoteEvent
 * objects for a given kind of event are given a sequence number relative to
 * the transaction. This is true even if the event that triggered the
 * RemoteEvent object being sent occurs outside of the scope of the
 * transaction (but is visible within the transaction).
 * <p>
 * In future it is planned for RemoteEvent to become immutable and all state
 * made private, all fields will be made final and private.
 * <p>
 * This change breaks compatibility for subclasses that access these fields
 * directly.  For other classes, all fields were accessible
 * via public API getter methods.
 * <p>
 * To allow an upgrade path for subclasses that extend RemoteEvent and
 * provide public setter methods for these fields, it is recommended to
 * override all public methods and maintain state independently using 
 * transient fields.  The subclass should also use RemoteEvent getter 
 * methods to set these transient fields during de-serialization.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses will be responsible for synchronization of mutable state.
 * <p>
 * writeObject, instead of writing RemoteEvent fields, writes the 
     * result of all getter methods to the ObjectOutputStream, during serialization,
 * preserving serial form compatibility wither earlier versions, while 
 * also allowing mutable subclasses to maintain full serial compatibility.
 * <p>
 * Mutable subclasses honoring this contract will be compatible with all 
 * versions since Jini 1.0.
