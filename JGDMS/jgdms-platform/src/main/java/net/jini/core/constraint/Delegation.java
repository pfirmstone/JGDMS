/**
 * Represents a constraint on delegation from the client to the server.
 * If the client delegates to the server, the server receives credentials
 * which allow the server to authenticate using the client's identity in
 * subsequent remote calls that the server makes or receives. (The credentials
 * should at least be sufficient for the authentication mechanism used
 * between the original client and server; they might not be sufficient if a
 * different mechanism is used when exercising the delegation.)
 * <p>
 * The use of an instance of this constraint does not directly imply a
 * {@link ClientAuthentication#YES} constraint; that must be specified
 * separately to ensure that the client actually authenticates itself.
 * <p>
 * Serialization for this class is guaranteed to produce instances that are
 * comparable with <code>==</code>.
