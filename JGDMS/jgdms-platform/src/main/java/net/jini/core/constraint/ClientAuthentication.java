/**
 * Represents a constraint on authentication of the client to the server.
 * <p>
 * Network authentication by a client (to a server) is scoped and controlled
 * by the client's {@link javax.security.auth.Subject}. The client's subject
 * is the current subject associated with the thread making the remote call.
 * The subject for a thread normally is set using
 * {@link javax.security.auth.Subject#doAs Subject.doAs}, and is retrieved
 * from a thread by calling {@link javax.security.auth.Subject#getSubject
 * Subject.getSubject} with the thread's current access control context (given
 * by calling {@link java.security.AccessController#getContext
 * AccessController.getContext}).
 * <p>
 * A client can only authenticate itself in a remote call as some subset of
 * the principals in its <code>Subject</code>, and only if that subject
 * contains the necessary public and/or private credentials required for the
 * authentication mechanism used by the proxy and server implementations.
 * However, additional principals and credentials might be derived as a result
 * of authentication. A client generally must have permission (such as
 * {@link net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission}) to authenticate itself
 * in a remote call.
 * <p>
 * In the server, the result of authenticating the client typically is
 * represented by a subject containing the subset of authenticated client
 * principals plus any derived principals, and the public credentials used
 * during authentication plus any derived public credentials. This subject
 * typically is used by the server for authorization (access control)
 * decisions; in particular, it is used to decide if the client is permitted
 * to make the remote call. This subject normally does not contain any private
 * credentials, and so cannot be used for authentication in further remote
 * calls, unless {@link Delegation} is used.
 * <p>
 * Serialization for this class is guaranteed to produce instances that are
 * comparable with <code>==</code>.
