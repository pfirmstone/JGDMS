package net.jini.core.constraint;

/**
 * Represents an invariant constraint on {@link java.io.ObjectInput} and 
 * {@link java.io.ObjectOutput}, covering data transmitted in band as part
 * of the remote call itself. 
 * If an invariant violation on in-band data is detected during a remote
 * call, a {@link java.io.InvalidObjectException} will be thrown, construction of the Object
 * in question will fail atomically
 * (in the client or in the server, depending on which side detected the violation).
 * Invariant validation is fine grained, which means every Object in the 
 * graph must have its invariants satisfied, prior to java.lang.Object's 
 * constructor being called.  This ensures that an object instance cannot be
 * created if invariants are not satisfied.
 * <p>
 * Java's standard {@link java.io.ObjectOutputStream} and {@link java.io.ObjectInputStream}
 * check invariants after construction, circular links and finalizers allow
 * an attacker to obtain references to partially constructed objects before
 * invariants have been checked.
 * <p>
 * Serialization for this class is guaranteed to produce instances that are
 * comparable with <code>==</code>.
