         *  discarded from only one of those utilities. Then when the discarded
         *  event is received by the listener registered with the utility from
         *  which the registrar was discarded, the listener - based on the
         *  current discovered state of the registrar - determines whether to: 
         *  discard the registrar from the other utility, send a discarded
         *  event out to the client's listener, or simply update state and
         *  do nothing more.
         *
         *  This chaining mechanism helps to present a single event
         *  source to the client listeners. That is, even though the
         *  two discovery utilities used internally by this 
         *  <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> operate independently,
         *  sending discarded events to the group discovery listener and/or
         *  the locator discovery listener, this chaining mechanism enables
         *  the coordination of those separate events so that only one 
         *  event is sent to the client listeners, even though multiple 
         *  events may have been received here.
         *
         *  Although this chaining mechanism is helpful in coordinating the
         *  discarded events received from the <code>LookupDiscovery</code>
         *  and <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utilities, the
         *  actual reason it must be used is due to the fact that

         *  discarded event - referred to as "passive communication
         *  discard"; whereas <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> cannot.
         *  Recall that <code>LookupDiscovery</code> monitors the
         *  registrars it has discovered for reachability, whereas
         *  <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> does not. When the
         *  <code>LookupDiscovery</code> sends a passive communication
         *  discard because it has determined that one of its registrars
         *  has become unreachable, if that registrar was also discovered
         *  via locator discovery, it is necessary to discard the registrar
         *  from the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> as well. In

         *   <li> The method <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery.discard</code>
         *        was called because the reg was determined to be unreachable
         *        (this is referred to as a "communication discard").
         *   <li> Either the method <code>setLocators</code> or the method
         *        <code>removeLocators</code> was called on the
         *        <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>, and the resulting new
         *        set of desired locators no longer contains an element
         *        equal to the locator of the discarded reg (this is referred
         *        to as a "no-interest discard").
         *  </ul><p>
         *  Depending on the type of discarded event received from the
         *  <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> as described above, and
         *  depending on whether the discarded reg was previously discovered
         *  by locator discovery alone, or by both group and locator discovery,
         *  this method will determine whether or not to pass a discarded
         *  event on to the client's listener. (Note that because the discarded
         *  event was sent by the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>,
         *  the discarded reg could not have been previously discovered by
         *  group discovery alone.)
         *
         *  The following describes the logic used by this method to determine
         *  whether or not to send a discarded event to the client listeners
         *  registered with this <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>. Note
         *  that since the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> is accessible
         *  only from within this <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>, the
         *  method <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery.discard</code> is never called
         *  from "outside" of this <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>.
         *  This fact is exploited to communicate to this method that a
         *  communication discard has occurred. That is, when
         *  <code>LookupDiscoveryManager.discard</code> is called, a boolean
         *  associated with the discarded reg is set to <code>true</code> to
         *  indicate that a communication discard has occurred.
         *
         *  Thus, for a particular reg referenced in the given discarded event,
         *  <p><ul>  
         *   <li> if the discarded event is a result of a call to 
         *        <code>LookupDiscoveryManager.discard</code>, then this
         *        method will conclude that the discarded event must be a 
         *        communication discard (indicated by the value of the
         *        boolean set by <code>LookupDiscoveryManager.discard</code>
         *        and associated with the discarded reg). When the discard is
         *        a communication discard, if the reg was previously
         *        discovered by only locator discovery, this method sends a
         *        discarded event. But if the reg was previously discovered
         *        by group discovery as well as locator discovery,
         *        then rather than sending a discarded event here,
         *        <code>LookupDiscovery.discard</code> is called (through
         *        a call to <code>reg.discard</code>), which will send a
         *        discarded event to <code>GroupDiscoveryListener</code>, which
         *        then ultimately sends a discarded event to the registered
         *        listeners of this <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>.
         *   <li> if the discarded event is NOT a result of a call to
         *        <code>LookupDiscoveryManager.discard</code> (is not a
         *        communication discard), then this method will conclude
         *        that the discarded event must be a no-interest discard.
         *        When the discard is a no-interest discard, if the discarded
         *        reg was previously discovered by ONLY locator discovery,
         *        then a discarded event is sent; otherwise, no event is sent
         *        (see section DU.2.5.1 of the "Jini Discovery Utilities
         *        Specification").
