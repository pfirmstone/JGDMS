/**
 * Whenever the lookup discovery service discovers or discards a lookup
 * service matching the discovery/discard criteria of one or more of its 
 * registrations, the lookup discovery service sends an instance of this
 * class to the listener corresponding to each such registration.
 * <p>
 * For each registration created by the lookup discovery service, an event
 * identifier is generated. That event identifier uniquely maps the
 * registration to the listener (submitted by the client to the lookup
 * discovery service during the registration process) and to the set of
 * groups and locators the client is interested in discovering. The event
 * identifier is unique across all other active registrations with the
 * lookup discovery service, and is sent to the listener as part of the
 * event.
 * <p>
 * Because clients of the lookup discovery service need to know not only 
 * when a targeted lookup service has been discovered, but also when it 
 * has been discarded, the lookup discovery service uses an instance of
 * this class to notify a client's registration(s) when either of these
 * events occurs.
 * <p>
 * This class extends RemoteEvent, adding the following additional items
 * of abstract state: a boolean indicating whether the lookup services
 * referenced by the event have been discovered or discarded; and a set
 * consisting of proxy objects where each proxy is a marshalled instance
 * of the ServiceRegistrar interface, and each is a proxy of one of the
 * recently discovered or discarded lookup service(s). Methods are defined
 * through which this additional state may be retrieved upon receipt of an
 * instance of this class.
 * <p>
 * The sequence numbers for a given event identifier are "strictly
 * increasing". This means that when any two such successive events
 * have sequence numbers differing by only a value of 1, then it is
 * guaranteed that no events have been missed. On the other hand, when
 * viewing the set of received events in order, if the difference 
 * between the sequence numbers of two successive events is greater
 * than 1, then one or more events may or may not have been missed.
 * For example, a difference greater than 1 could occur if the lookup
 * discovery service crashes, even if no events are lost because of
 * the crash. When two successive events have sequence numbers whose
 * difference is greater than 1, there is said to be a "gap" between
 * the events.
 * <p>
 * When a gap occurs between events, the state of the locally managed
 * set of lookup services may or may not fall "out of sync" with the
 * corresponding remote state. For example, if the gap corresponds to
 * a missed event representing the (initial) discovery of a targeted
 * lookup service, the remote state will reflect this discovery whereas
 * the local state will not. When such a situation occurs, clients may
 * wish to employ the methods of the corresponding registration object
 * to query the current remote state in order to update the current
 * local state. 
 * <p>
 * Thus, clients typically use this class to determine if conditions
 * are right for a loss of synchronization (by verifying the existence
 * of a gap in the event sequence). Clients then typically use the
 * methods provided by the registration object to both determine if a
 * loss of synchronization has actually occurred, and to correct
 * such a situation when it does occur.

     * of the client's registration. Note that a new array is returned
     * on every call.
     * <p>
     * When the lookup discovery service sends an instance of this event
     * class to the listener of a client's registration, the set of lookup
     * service proxies contained in the event is sent as a set of marshalled
     * instances of the ServiceRegistrar interface. Thus, in order to 
     * construct the return set, this method attempts to unmarshal each
     * element of that set of proxies. Should a failure occur while
     * attempting to unmarshal any of the elements of the set of marshalled
     * proxy objects contained in the current instance of this class, this
     * method will throw an exception of type LookupUnmarshalException. 
     * <p>
     * When a LookupUnmarshalException is thrown by this method, the
     * contents of the exception provides the client with the following
     * useful information: (1) the knowledge that a problem has occurred
     * while unmarshalling at least one of the as yet unmarshalled proxy
     * objects, (2) the set consisting of the proxy objects that were
     * successfully unmarshalled (either on the current invocation of
     * this method or on some previous invocation), (3) the set consisting
     * of the marshalled proxy objects that could not be unmarshalled
     * during the current or any previous invocation of this method, and
     * (4) the set of exceptions corresponding to each failed attempt at
     * unmarshalling during the current invocation of this method.
     * <p>
     * Typically, the type of exception that occurs when attempting to
     * unmarshal an element of the set of marshalled proxies is either an
     * IOException or a ClassNotFoundException. A ClassNotFoundException 
     * occurs whenever a remote field of the marshalled proxy cannot be
     * retrieved (usually because the codebase of one of the field's classes
     * or interfaces is currently 'down'). To address this situation, the
     * client may wish to invoke this method at some later time when the
     * 'down' codebase(s) may be accessible. Thus, the client can invoke
     * this method multiple times until all of the elements of the set of
     * marshalled proxies can be successfully unmarshalled.
     * <p>
     * Note that once an element of the set of marshalled proxy objects has
     * been successfully unmarshalled on a particular invocation of this
     * method, the resulting unmarshalled proxy is stored for return on
     * all future invocations of this method. That is, once successfully
     * unmarshalled, no attempt will be made to unmarshal that element on
     * any future invocations of this method. Thus, if this method returns
     * successfully without throwing a LookupUnmarshalException, the client
     * is guaranteed that all marshalled proxies have been successfully
     * unmarshalled; and any future invocations of this method will return
     * successfully.
     *

     *         lookup service(s) corresponding to this event.
