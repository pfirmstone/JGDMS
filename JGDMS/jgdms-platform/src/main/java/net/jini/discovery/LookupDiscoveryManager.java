/** 
 * This class is a helper utility class that organizes and manages all
 * discovery-related activities on behalf of a client or service. Rather
 * than providing its own facility for coordinating and maintaining
 * all of the necessary state information related to group names,
 * {@link LookupLocator} objects, and {@link DiscoveryListener}
 * objects, clients and services can employ this class to provide those
 * facilities on their behalf.
 * <p>
 *
 *  <!-- Implementation Specifics -->
 *
 * The following implementation-specific items are discussed below:
 * <ul><li> <a href="#ldmConfigEntries">Configuring LookupDiscoveryManager</a>
 *     <li> <a href="#ldmLogging">Logging</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a name="ldmConfigEntries"><b>Configuring LookupDiscoveryManager</b></a>
 * <p>
 * Currently, there are no configuration entries directly supported by this
 * implementation of <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>. All configuration
 * entries affecting the operation of this utility are retrieved by either
 * the {@link LookupDiscovery} utility, or the {@link LookupLocatorDiscovery}
 * utility. Please refer to the documentation provided with those utilities
 * when configuring the behavior of <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code>.
 * </p>
 * <a name="ldmLogging"><b>Logging</b></a>
 * <p>
 * With one exception, all logging information produced
 * when using this utility is controlled by the loggers supported by the
 * following utilities:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li> {@link LookupDiscovery} 
 *  <li> {@link LookupLocatorDiscovery} 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This implementation of <code>LookupDiscoveryManager</code> uses the {@link Logger}
 * named <code>net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryManager</code> to log information
 * at the following logging levels: </p>
 * 
 * <table border="1" cellpadding="5"
 *       summary="Describes the information logged by LookupDiscoveryManager, and
 *                 the levels at which that information is logged">
 * 
 * <caption>
 *   <b><code>net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryManager</code></b>
 * </caption>
 *
 * <tr> <th scope="col"> Level</th>
 *      <th scope="col"> Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * 
 * <tr>
 *   <td>{@link Levels#HANDLED HANDLED}</td>
 *   <td>
 *     when this utility asynchronously invokes a {@link net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryListener}
 *     implementation and that listener throws and unchecked exception. If the listener throws
 *     in a synchronous path (namely, via {@link #addDiscoveryListener(DiscoveryListener)}) then
 *     the exception is not trapped and will instead throw back to the caller.
