/**
 * This class encapsulates the functionality required of an entity that
 * wishes to employ the unicast discovery protocol to discover a lookup
 * service. This utility provides an implementation that makes the process
 * of finding specific lookup services much simpler for both services and
 * clients.
 * <p>
 * Because this class participates in only the unicast discovery protocol,
 * and because the unicast discovery protocol imposes no restriction on the
 * physical location of the entity relative to a lookup service, this utility
 * can be used to discover lookup services running on hosts that are located
 * far from, or near to, the host on which the entity is running. This lack
 * of a restriction on location brings with it a requirement that the
 * discovering entity supply this class with specific information about the
 * desired lookup services; namely, the location of the device(s) hosting
 * each lookup service. This information is supplied through an instance
 * of the {@link net.jini.core.discovery.LookupLocator LookupLocator} class,
 * or its subclass {@link net.jini.discovery.ConstrainableLookupLocator
 * ConstrainableLookupLocator}.
 *

 * <a name="lldConfigEntries"><b>Configuring LookupLocatorDiscovery</b></a>
 *
 * This implementation of <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> supports the
 * following configuration entries; where each configuration entry name
 * is associated with the component name
 * <code>net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>. Note that the
 * configuration entries specified here are specific to this implementation
 * of <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code>. Unless otherwise stated, each
 * entry is retrieved from the configuration only once per instance of
 * this utility, where each such retrieval is performed in the constructor.

 *       If the value is positive, initial unicast discovery requests
 *       will be delayed by a random value between <code>0</code> and
 *       <code>initialUnicastDelayRange</code> milliseconds. Once the wait
 *       period is up, the <code>LookupLocator</code>s specified at construction
 *       time are used for initiating unicast discovery requests, unless the
 *       managed <code>LookupLocator</code>s have been changed in the interim;
 *       in which case, no delayed unicast discovery requests are performed.
 *       Note that this entry only has effect when this utility is initialized.
 *       It does not delay discovery requests that are initiated if the managed
 *       <code>LookupLocator</code>s are subsequently changed.
