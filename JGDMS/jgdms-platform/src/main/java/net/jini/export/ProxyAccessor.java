/**
 * Provides a means to obtain a proxy from an exported remote object.
 *
 * <p>This interface is typically used in conjunction with activatable
 * remote objects.  An activatable remote object can implement this
 * interface so that its proxy can be obtained once the object is
 * activated.  If an activatable remote object does not implement this
 * interface, it must define a constructor that takes as arguments an
 * {@link net.jini.activation.arg.ActivationID} and a {@link
 * java.rmi.MarshalledObject}, and it must be serializable and marshalling
 * the object produces a suitable proxy for the remote object.
