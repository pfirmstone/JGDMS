/**
 * ThreadPool is a simple thread pool implementation of the Executor
 * interface.
 *
 * A new task is always given to an idle thread, if one is available;
 * otherwise, a new thread is always created.  There is no minimum
 * warm thread count, nor is there a maximum thread count (tasks are
 * never queued unless there are sufficient idle threads to execute
 * them).
 *
 * New threads are created as daemon threads in the thread group that
 * was passed to the ThreadPool instance's constructor.  Each thread's
 * name is the prefix NewThreadAction.NAME_PREFIX followed by the name
 * of the task it is currently executing, or "Idle" if it is currently
 * idle.
 *
 * <p>This implementation uses the {@link Logger} named
 * <code>org.apache.river.thread.ThreadPool</code> to
 * log information at the following levels:
 *
 * <p><table summary="Describes what is logged by ThreadPool at
 * various logging levels" border=1 cellpadding=5>
 *
 * <tr> <th> Level <th> Description
 *
 * <tr> <td> {@link Level#WARNING WARNING} <td> uncaught exception in
 * worker thread
 *

     * This Executor is used by JERI (and other Jini implementation classes) 
     * to delegate tasks to, the intent is to hand off to a new thread 
     * immediately, however:
     *
     * 1. When ThreadPool creates threads too aggressively, stress tests in the 
     * qa suite create too many threads and hang because tasks that need to 
     * respond within a required time cannot.  
     * 
     * 2. Conversely when thread creation takes too long, Javaspace tests that 
     * rely on event propagation to cancel a LeasedResource find that lease still 
     * available after lease expiry.
     * 
     * 3. If no threads are available when JERI needs to start a Mux connection,
     * then a mux writer cannot initiate a client connection, for this reason, a
     * new thread must be created if no waiting threads are available to the caller.
     * 
     * ThreadPool must degrade gracefully when a system is under significant
     * load, but it must also execute tasks as soon as possible.
     * 
     * ThreadGroup is a construct originally intended for applet isolation, 
     * however it was never really successful, AccessControlContext 
     * is a much more effective way of controlling privilege.
     * 
     * We should consider changing this to ensure that each task is executed in the
     * AccessControlContext of the calling thread, to avoid privilege escalation.
