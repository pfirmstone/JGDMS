/**
 * This class provides a blocking mechanism that will not proceed while
 * some operation bounded by this object is in progress.  The thread
 * performing the operation invokes <code>start</code> and
 * <code>stop</code> on this object when it starts and stops the
 * operation in progress.  The thread that wants to block itself while
 * the operation is in progress invokes <code>waitWhileStarted</code>,
 * which will block if <code>start</code> has been invoked without a
 * matching <code>stop</code>.  The block will continue until a
 * matching <code>stop</code> is invoked.  Each <code>start</code> adds
 * one to the number of operations; each <code>stop</code> subtracts
 * one.  When the number of operations is zero, the operation bounded
 * by this object is not in progress, and <code>waitWhileStarted</code>
 * will return.
 * <p>
 * The operation can also be blocked by invoking <code>block</code> and
 * <code>unblock</code>, which nest like <code>start</code> and
 * <code>stop</code>.  When a <code>block</code> is invoked on this
 * object, no <code>start</code> will proceed until the matching
 * <code>unblock</code> call is made.  The reverse is also true: when a
 * <code>stop</code> call has been made on this object, no
 * <code>block</code> call will proceed until the matching
 * <code>stop</code> call is made.  A <code>waitUntilUnblocked</code>
 * method allows selective waiting for the unblocked state without
 * invoking <code>start</code>.
 * <p>
 * A <code>waitUntilQuiet</code> call waits until the object is neither
 * blocked nor stopped.
