/**
 * AbstractExecutorService introduced two protected methods in Java 1.6 to 
 * allow an ExecutorService to use customised RunnableFuture implementations
 * other than the default FutureTask.
 * 
 * This class requires a Factory to create the RunnableFuture, encapsulating
 * any existing ExecutorService.
 * 
 * This allows an ExecutorService to be provided by Configuration or a pool
 * to be shared without requiring that all implementations also share the same
 * type of RunnableFuture&lt;T&gt;.
