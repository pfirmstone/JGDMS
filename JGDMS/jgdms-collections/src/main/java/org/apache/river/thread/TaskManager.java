/**
 * A task manager manages a single queue of tasks, and some number of
 * worker threads.  New tasks are added to the tail of the queue.  Each
 * thread loops, taking a task from the queue and running it.  Each
 * thread looks for a task by starting at the head of the queue and
 * taking the first task (that is not already being worked on) that is
 * not required to run after any of the tasks that precede it in
 * the queue (including tasks that are currently being worked on).
 * <p>
 * This class uses the {@link Logger} named
 * <code>org.apache.river.thread.TaskManager</code> to log information at
 * the following logging levels:
