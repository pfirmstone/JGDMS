/**
 * Represents permissions that can be used to express the access control
 * policy for the activator, the remote object handling object activation,
 * if that remote object is exported with {@link
 * net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter}. This class can be passed to {@link
 * net.jini.jeri.BasicInvocationDispatcher}, and then used in security
 * policy permission grants.
 *
 * <p>This permission class can be used for server-side access control of
 * remote object activation initiated by the client-side {@link
 * java.rmi.activation.ActivationID#activate ActivationID.activate} method.
 * The server-side method name for this operation is <code>activate</code>.
 * 
 * <p>An instance contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no
 * actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't. The
 * convention is that the target name is the fully qualified name of the
 * remote method being invoked. Wildcard matches are supported using the
 * syntax specified by {@link AccessPermission}.
 * 
 * </p>
 * <table border=1 cellpadding=5>
 * <caption>The possible target names for the activator are:</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Permission Target Name</th>
 * <th>What the Permission Allows</th>
 * <th>Risks of Allowing this Permission</th>

 * <td>The caller can activate an object and obtain the proxy for it if it
