/**
 * Represents permissions that can be used to express the access control
 * policy for the {@link ActivationMonitor} remote object exported with
 * {@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter}. This class can be passed to
 * {@link net.jini.jeri.BasicInvocationDispatcher}, and then used in
 * security policy permission grants.
 *
 * <p>This permission class can also be used to grant permission to invoke
 * the method {@link net.jini.activation.arg.ActivationGroup#activeObject
 * ActivationGroup.activeObject}, {@link
 * net.jini.activation.arg.ActivationGroup#inactiveObject
 * ActivationGroup.inactiveObject }, or {@link
 * net.jini.activation.ActivationGroup#inactive ActivationGroup.inactive}.
 * 
 * <p>An instance contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but
 * no actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't. The
 * convention is that the target name is the fully qualified name of the
 * remote method being invoked. Wildcard matches are supported using the
 * syntax specified by {@link AccessPermission}.

 * <td>invoking {@link ActivationMonitor#activeObject

 * returned by the activator, if it knows the activation identifier.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ActivationMonitor.inactiveGroup</td>
 * <td>invoking {@link ActivationMonitor#inactiveGroup
 * ActivationMonitor.inactiveGroup}</td>

 * the incarnation.</td>
