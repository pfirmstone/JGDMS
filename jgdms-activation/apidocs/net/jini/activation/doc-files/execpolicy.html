<TITLE>Security requirements for specifying an Activation Group Descriptor</TITLE>

<BODY LINK="#0000ff" VLINK="#800080" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Security Requirements on Activation Group Descriptors used with <code>phoenix</code> or <code>rmid</code>
</H1>
 <ul>

<p>Some Jini network technology-based services may be activatable and
as such will require the use of an activation daemon.  The standard
Java(TM) 2 Standard Edition (J2SE(TM)) Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) activation daemon is
<code>rmid</code>.  The JGDMS release
provides <code>phoenix</code>, an alternative
configurable implementation of a Java RMI activation daemon.

<p>This note describes the security requirements to specify an
activation group descriptor (of type
<code>java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupDesc</code>) for use with
activatable objects handled by either <code>phoenix</code> or
<code>rmid</code>.

<p><i>Note</i>: We encourage developers to transition from <code>rmid</code>
and to use its configurable alternative <code>phoenix</code>
instead.  The <code>phoenix</code> activation daemon supports
configurable exporters for the remote objects that are part of the
activation system and also supports flexible access control policies
for the activation system.  See the <code>org.apache.river.phoenix</code>
package documentation for details on configuring and starting
<code>phoenix</code>.

<p>
<H2>
Introduction and Rationale
</H2>
<P>
   An activation daemon, such as <code>phoenix</code> or
   <code>rmid</code>, executes subprocesses which run virtual machines
   for the Java platform (VMs).  It does this to
   keep activation groups separate from one another, and to allow the
   use of special VM engines and options for different activation
   groups.
<P>
   An activation group is specified by an activation group descriptor
   that describes the information necessary for an
   activation daemon to start the activation group.  An application
   can register an activation group descriptor (of type
   <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code>) directly with the
   <code>ActivationSystem</code> of either <code>phoenix</code> or
   <code>rmid</code> by calling the <code>ActivationSystem</code>'s
   <code>registerGroup</code> method.  Alternatively, an activation
   group can be registered via the service starter API, by invoking
   the <code>create</code> method on a
   <code>org.apache.river.start.SharedActivationGroupDescriptor</code>
   instance.   As a side effect of this invocation, an
   <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> is created and registered with the
   <code>ActivationSystem</code> as above.
<p>
   An activation group descriptor used to start an activation
   group affects the subprocess environment, command,  
   command options, and arguments for starting the activation group,
   and is flexible enough that with an insecure security policy, any
   command, even a non-Java-platform command or program, can be run
   under the guise of starting the group.  There is clearly a need
   for a security control to prevent unauthorized specification of an
   activation group descriptor and hence unauthorized execution
   of a command.  Note that whether an activation group is
   registered directly with the <code>ActivationSystem</code> or
   registered indirectly as a result of the
   <code>SharedActivationGroupDescriptor.create</code> method, the
   security requirements outlined below are the same for each situation.
<P>
   The activation daemons <code>phoenix</code> and <code>rmid</code>
   have different schemes for preventing an unauthorized
   activation group descriptor from being used.  The <code>phoenix</code>
   activation daemon may be configured with an access control policy
   on its <code>ActivationSystem</code> that prevents an unauthorized
   <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> from either being registered via the
   <code>ActivationSystem.registerGroup</code> method or being
   modified via the <code>ActivationSystem.setActivationGroupDesc</code>
   method.  The <code>rmid</code> activation daemon has a slightly
   different control point: it verifies that an
   <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> is authorized (according to
   <code>rmid</code>'s security policy) just before
   using it to create an activation group.  The details of each access
   control model are discussed in turn below.  Although
   <code>phoenix</code> and <code>rmid</code> have different points in
   which they check permissions for such access, the basic permission
   requirements are the same.  Also, the permission types that
   <code>phoenix</code> uses are modeled after the permission types
   used by <code>rmid</code> (<code>ExecPermission</code> and
   <code>ExecOptionPermission</code>); each permission type has the
   same class name, but is in a different package. 

<p>
<hr>
<H2>
<code>phoenix</code>
</H2>

<p>Since applications need to configure the access control policy for
registering and updating an activation group descriptor with the
<code>ActivationSystem</code>, the <code>phoenix</code> implementation
includes a special <code>net.jini.export.Exporter</code>
implementation for the <code>ActivationSystem</code>,
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.SystemAccessExporter</code>, that allows
the <code>ActivationSystem</code>'s access control policy to be
configured.  The <code>phoenix</code> implementation also includes a
<code>net.jini.jeri.InvocationLayerFactory</code> implementation,
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.SystemAccessILFactory</code>, to use with
<code>net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter</code>.  This
<code>InvocationLayerFactory</code> implementation supports the same
configurable access control policy for the
<code>ActivationSystem</code>.

<p>By default, <code>phoenix</code>'s <code>ActivationSystem</code> is
exported via <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> with a
<code>SystemAccessILFactory</code> that produces a
<code>net.jini.jeri.Dispatcher</code> that enforces an access control
policy on calls to the <code>registerGroup</code> and
<code>setActivationGroupDesc</code> methods.  The default access
control policy is specified by the
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.DefaultGroupPolicy.checkGroup</code>
method.

<p>This default group policy requires the following when an
<code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> is being recorded via the
<code>registerGroup</code> or <code>setActivationGroupDesc</code>
method:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The group class name in the descriptor is either
<code>null</code> (indicating the default) or specifically
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.ActivationGroupImpl</code>.

<li>For each property in the descriptor's property overrides, the
calling context is granted the permission
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.ExecOptionPermission</code> with a target
of the form "-D<i>name</i>=<i>value</i>" (where <i>name</i> is the
name of the property and <i>value</i> is the value of the property).

<li>If the descriptor contains a non-<code>null</code> command
environment, the calling context is granted the permission
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix.ExecPermission</code> with the command path
as the target.  Also, for each command option, the calling context is
granted <code>ExecOptionPermission</code> with the option as a target.
</ul>

<p>These permissions must be specified in <code>phoenix</code>'s security
policy file, indicated on the command line when starting up
<code>phoenix</code>:

<pre>
java -J-Djava.security.policy=<i>configDir</i>/phoenix.policy  
     -J-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=<i>codebasePath</i> [<i>otherOptions</i>]
     -jar <i>installDir</i>/lib/phoenix.jar <i>configOptions</i>
</pre>

where <i>configDir</i> is the directory containing
<code>phoenix</code>'s security policy file, <i>codebasePath</i> is a
codebase path (space-separated list of URLs that serves up
<code>phoenix</code>'s download JAR file
(<i>installDir</i><code>/lib/phoenix-dl.jar</code>),
<i>otherOptions</i> are any other standard options for the
<code>java</code> command, and <i>configOptions</i> are the options
(typically a filename or URL) of a <code>phoenix</code> configuration.

<p>Some things to keep in mind when defining permissions
for <code>phoenix</code> are:
<p> <ul>

<li>Although in many cases all or part of the command line will be
case insensitive (e.g. host names, files, and command paths on some
operating systems), the checks <code>ExecPermission</code> and
<code>ExecOptionPermission</code> perform are case sensitive, so it is
important to make sure the case of the targets of the
<code>ExecPermission</code>s and <code>ExecOptionPermission</code>s
match the case of the command line elements in the
<code>ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment</code>.

<li>Because <code>phoenix</code> can be configured to support
authentication and access control, it may be reasonable to grant more
broad <code>ExecPermission</code>s and
<code>ExecOptionPermission</code>s to a narrow set of trusted
subjects.

</ul>

<p>Note that the permission class names <code>ExecPermission</code>
and <code>ExecOptionPermission</code> are the same as those used for
<code>rmid</code>'s access control policy except for the package name,
which, for <code>phoenix</code>, is <code>org.apache.river.phoenix</code>.
The <a href="#examples"> examples given for <code>rmid</code></a>
below are the same as for <code>phoenix</code> except that the package
name for the permissions needs to be changed to
<code>org.apache.river.phoenix</code>.

<p>
<hr>
<H2>
<code>rmid</code>
</H2>

<P>
   In releases of the Java 2 SDK prior to 1.2.2_006, the need to
   control the security of an <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> was
   satisfied by the same stopgap measure used for 
   <CODE>rmiregistry</CODE> access control: if the caller was running
   on the same host as the remote object, then all access was allowed;
   otherwise, no access to sensitive functions was allowed.
   Registering or changing an <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE> is an
   example of a sensitive function; activating an object is an example
   of a non-sensitive function that anyone can perform.  This security
   mechanism was predicated on the assumption that unprivileged code is
   not allowed to connect to port 1098 on the executing host.
<P>
   However, that assumption is no longer as certain, and a
   stronger security model has been developed.  In this new model, an extra security control has been added:
   before being executed, the command and options requested by an
   <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE> are checked by the security manager
   of <CODE>rmid</CODE>, which then references the security policy file
   that was set for <CODE>rmid</CODE> from the command line (for
   authorization).
<P>
   An "exec policy" is a Java class employed by the Java RMI activation
   daemon to check commands and command-line options used to launch a
   VM when deciding whether or not an <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE>
   is authorized.  The exec policy is adopted when <CODE>rmid</CODE> is
   started.  The value of the <code>sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy</code>
   property dictates the policy that <code>rmid</code> uses to
   determine whether or not the information in an
   <code>ActivationGroupDesc</code> may be used to launch a VM
   for an activation group. Some exec policies are built into
   <CODE>rmid</CODE>, and <CODE>rmid</CODE> can be instructed to use
   one of them by defining a property that specifies a built-in policy
   instead of the exec policy's class name.
<P>
   In the exec policy represented by the value <CODE>none</CODE>
   (discussed later, in the section, <a href="#prev"><i>How to achieve the
   behavior of </i><code>rmid</code><i> released in previous versions of the
   Java 2 SDK</i></a>), the new security control is disabled, and
   execution is compatible with the <CODE>rmid</CODE> found in previous
   releases of the Java 2 SDK.
<P>
   In the default exec policy (discussed in the section, <a
   href="#assign"><i>How to assign and maintain security
   controls</i></a>), the authorized commands and options are encoded
   in the security policy file, which gets set using the
   "<CODE>-J-Djava.security.policy=...</CODE>" option on the
   <CODE>rmid</CODE> command line.  Each command and option string in
   each <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE> is separately authorized or
   unauthorized.  While there is no authentication of a caller (an
   authorized option is authorized for everyone's use), there is still
   a check to ensure that the registration of the
   <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE> originates from the local host.
<P>
   The exec policy can be set to the name of another class that
   <CODE>rmid</CODE> will instantiate; the exec policy object will then
   be expected to perform the security check on
   <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE>s at group activation time.  This
   option is the most flexible, but discussion of its use is beyond the
   scope of this document. See the <CODE>rmid</CODE> tool documentation
   (manpage) for details, at:
<pre><a name="manpages">
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/rmid.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/rmid.html</a>
</pre>
     and

<pre>     <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/windows/rmid.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/windows/rmid.html</a>
</pre>
<P>
<H3><a name="prev">
How to achieve the behavior of <code>rmid</code> released in
previous versions of the Java 2 SDK</a></H3>
<P>
   The new security control can be effectively bypassed by assigning an
   exec policy that permits all commands and all options.  There is a
   short way to specify this behavior by setting the exec policy value
   to <CODE>none</CODE>:
<pre>
   rmid -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=none</pre>
 
   which will run <CODE>rmid</CODE> in the normal way, but will
   automatically authorize all <CODE>ActivationGroupDesc</CODE>s
   registered from the local host.

<P>
   For the user who can control the <CODE>rmid</CODE> host to guarantee the
   assumptions of Java 2 SDK, v1.2.x, or who is simply impatient with the new
   security control, the <CODE>none</CODE> keyword is a convenient way to get
   <CODE>rmid</CODE> up and running quickly.  Remember that this is a way to
   sacrifice security for temporary convenience, and therefore is not
   recommended.
<P>
<H3><a name="assign">
How to assign and maintain security controls
</a></H3>
<P>
   The default exec policy is used if the
   <CODE>sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy</CODE> system property is not
   set for the <CODE>rmid</CODE> tool, or if the value of the
   <CODE>execPolicy</CODE> property is set to <CODE>default</CODE>.  In
   this case, a security policy file must be specified on
   <CODE>rmid</CODE>'s command line.
<P>
   In the default case, the <CODE>java.security.policy</CODE> system
   property must be set for <CODE>rmid</CODE>. For example on a Microsoft Windows platform:
<pre>
   rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=<var><b>configDir</b></var>\rmid.policy</pre>
<P>
   The file named as the value of this property should contain a
   Java 2 platform security policy file.  An example which has
   appropriate syntax for the Microsoft Windows platform is:
<pre>
   grant {
     // permissions granted to everyone
     permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission "C:\\jdk\\bin\\java_g";
     permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission "-Djava.security.policy=<var><b>configDir</b></var>\\lookup.policy";
   };
</pre>
<P>
   The two permission types shown above, <code>ExecPermission</code>
   and <code>ExecOptionPermission</code>,  are the only two security
   permissions relevant to the new security control.  Notice that they
   are granted to all codebases (<CODE>grant {</CODE>): you should
   always be cautious when granting permissions to all codebases,
   because these permissions are also granted to unknown downloaded
   code. See <a href="#manpages">the <code>rmid</code> reference
   pages</a> for a complete description of the syntax for these
   permissions.
<P>
   The straightforward way to build up an effective
   <CODE>rmid.policy</CODE> is:
<OL>
   <LI> Start with an empty <CODE>rmid.policy</CODE>.

   <LI> Run <CODE>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy</CODE>.

   <LI> Run a client program to activate an object (you might need to
      register the object if you haven't already).

   <LI> Catch and <CODE>printStackTrace</CODE> the
      <CODE>AccessControlException</CODE> that gets
      thrown by the activation attempt (usually the client program will
      do this anyway).<br>
<P>
<B>     Note on restartable <CODE>Activatable</CODE> objects:</B> Some
	activatable objects are activated automatically by
	<CODE>rmid</CODE> (if
	<CODE>ActivationDesc.getRestartMode()</CODE> is
	<CODE>true</CODE>); in this case, <CODE>rmid</CODE> will
	<CODE>printStackTrace</CODE> the exception to its
	<CODE>System.err</CODE>, preceded by the English-language
	message "<CODE>rmid: unable to restart service</CODE>".
<P>


   <LI> Look in the <CODE>AccessControlException</CODE> to see the failed exception.
      For example, the exception:
<CODE><blockquote>
         java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission -cp)
</blockquote></CODE>
      means that the permission you need to add to the security policy
      file is:
<pre>
   grant {
     permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission "-cp";
   };
</pre>
   <LI> Kill the <CODE>rmid</CODE> process (<code>rmid -stop</code>)
   and return to step 2.
</OL>
