# This test uses a name service provider, unfortunately this doesn't seem to
# be working properly with Java 8 and IPv6.  From Java 9, this nameservice provider
# has been removed, thus this test cannot run.

#https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134577
#
#To facilitate testing activity, and provide a replacement for the
#customized NameService implementations in the
#JDK tests, the default NameService has been extended to support
#the retrieval of host to IP address mappings from a file.
#The file path is specified with a system property " jdk.internal.hosts".
#
#Previously a nameservice provider was specified by setting the system
#property
#"sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.", as per the documentation
#http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html
