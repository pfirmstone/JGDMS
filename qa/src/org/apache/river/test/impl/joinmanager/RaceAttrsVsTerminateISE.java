     *  should be visually inspected for a stack trace containing
     *  IllegalStateException.
     *
     *  Note that in order to create the conditions that can result in
     *  an IllegalStateException, the JoinManager must be instrumented,
     *  and the test must be run, in the following way:
     *
     * 1. Place a 5 second delay in JoinManager.setAttributes, just prior
     *    to the call to srvcRegistration.setAttributes(attSet)
     * 2. Use the instrumented JoinManager to register a service with a
     *    lookup service and then call setAttributes() (or addAttributes()
     *    or modifyAttributes()),  delay 5 seconds (probably best to delay
     *    the same amount of time as in the JoinManager), then call
     *    terminate(). 
     * 
     * Without the bug fix in JoinManager, this should cause a stack trace
     * originating in the WakeupManager to be displayed.
