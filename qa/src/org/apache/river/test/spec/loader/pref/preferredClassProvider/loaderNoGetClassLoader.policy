    // Read permissions must be granted from the top-level root 
    // directory because the various policy files (ex. policy.reggie,
    // policy.fiddler, etc.) and the various executable jar files 
    // (ex. reggie.jar, fiddler.jar, etc.) must be read by the harness. 
    // Since the test suite may be installed into any directory 
    // (the 'installDir' item in qaHarness.prop), it is impossible to 
    // know a priori the path to the policy and jar files. Therefore, 
    // this policy file allows read permission for all files throughout
    // the whole disk.
    // 
    // Since the test harness creates, accesses, and ultimately deletes 
    // a number of temporary files in the current working directory, 
    // read, write, and delete permissions must be granted for all
    // files in the current working directory. (Note that read permission
    // is already granted to all files in the current working directory
    // when read permission was granted for all files on the disk.)

    // on Win95/98), read, write, and delete permissions must be
    // given for each of those directories. As with the current directory,
    // read permission is already granted for all files in the system
    // tmp directory when read permission was granted for all files on
