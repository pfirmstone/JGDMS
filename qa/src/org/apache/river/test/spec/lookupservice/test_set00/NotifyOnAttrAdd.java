     *  and collected. Determines if all of the expected -- as well as 
     *  no un-expected -- events have arrived. This test depends on the 
     *  semantics of event-notification. That is, it uses the fact that 
     *  if the events were generated for each service item in sequence 
     *  (which they were), then the events will arrive in that same sequence. 
     *  This means one can expect, when examining the event corresponding 
     *  to index i, that the service ID returned in the ServiceEvent should 
     *  correspond to the i_th service item registered. If it does not, then 
     *  failure is declared. Thus, this test does the following:  1. Verifies
     *  that the number of expected events equals the number of events that 
     *  have arrived. 2. Verifies that the transition returned in event[i] 
     *  corresponds to the expected transition (MATCH_MATCH). 3. Verifies 
     *  that the service ID returned in event[i] equals the service ID
     *  of the i_th service registered. 4. Verifies that the handback 
     *  returned in the i_th event object equals the service ID of the 
     *  i_th service.
