    <LI><a name="install"><B>Installing the <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> file</B></a>
<p>
This release includes a security policy provider which supports dynamic
granting of permissions at run-time. Although use of this policy provider
is not required, its use is highly recommended when deploying secure
applications and services. To permit effective use of this policy provider,
it must first be installed as an extension in the Java 2 SDK (or JRE)
that you will be using. Note that installing this provider does not
automatically cause it to be used, and its installation should not alter
the operation of existing applications.

<p> To install this policy provider, providing you didn't do so during your initial installation, 
you must copy the <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> file from the <code>lib-ext</code> 
subdirectory of your JGDMS release installation to 
the extensions directory of your Java(TM) 2 SDK (or JRE) installation.

<p> An alternative to copying <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> to the extension directory is
to use the system property <code>java.ext.dirs</code>. This property specifies one or
more directories to search for extensions, each separated by <code>File.pathSeparatorChar</code>.
To use <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> in this manner, the system property
must be set to include both the path to the Java 2 JRE extension directory
(or directories) and the path to the <code>lib-ext</code> subdirectory of
your JGDMS release installation.
Note that in Java(TM) 2 Standard Edition (J2SE(TM)) 1.4, only the original extension directory
is granted permissions via the system policy file, so you will have to explicitly grant
permissions to <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> in your own policy files. In J2SE 5.0, all the
directories specified in <code>java.ext.dirs</code> are granted permissions so the explicit
permission grant is not needed.
