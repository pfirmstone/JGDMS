<h2>LU - Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Lookup Service Specification<br>
</h2>
<h3 class="Heading2">
  <a name="1021843"> </a>LU.1	 Introduction
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  The Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> lookup service is a fundamental part of the federation infrastructure for a <em class="Emphasis">djinn,</em> the group of devices, resources, and users that are joined by the Jini technology infrastructure. The<em class="Emphasis"> lookup service</em> provides a central registry of services available within the djinn. This lookup service is a primary means for programs to find services within the djinn, and is the foundation for providing user interfaces through which users and administrators can discover and interact with services in the djinn.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997331"> </a>Although the primary purpose of this specification is to define the interface to the djinn's central service registry, the interfaces defined here can readily be used in other service registries.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="996907"> </a>LU.1.1	 The Lookup Service Model
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1021778"> </a>The lookup service maintains a flat collection of <em class="Emphasis">service</em> <em class="Emphasis">items</em>. Each service item represents an instance of a service available within the djinn. The item contains the Java(TM) Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) stub (if the service is implemented as a remote object) or other object (if the service makes use of a local proxy) that programs use to access the service, and an extensible collection of attributes that describe the service or provide secondary interfaces to the service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997180"> </a>When a new service is created (for example, when a new device is added to the djinn), the service registers itself with the djinn's lookup service, providing an initial collection of attributes. For example, a printer might include attributes indicating speed (in pages per minute), resolution (in dots per inch), and whether duplex printing is supported. Among the attributes might be an indicator that the service is new and needs to be configured.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997190"> </a>An administrator uses the event mechanism of the lookup service to receive notifications as new services are registered. To configure the service, the administrator might look for an attribute that provides an applet for this purpose. The administrator might also use an applet to add new attributes, such as the physical location of the service and a common name for it; the service would receive these attribute change requests from the applet and respond by making the changes at the lookup service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997460"> </a>Programs (including other services) that need a particular type of service can use the lookup service to find an instance. A match can be made based on the specific data types for the Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> programming language implemented by the service as well as the specific attributes attached to the service. For example, a program that needs to make use of transactions might look for a service that supports the type <code>net.jini.core.transaction.server.TransactionManager</code> and might further qualify the match by desired location.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997193"> </a>Although the collection of service items is flat, a wide variety of hierarchical views can be imposed on the collection by aggregating items according to service types and attributes. The lookup service provides a set of methods to enable incremental exploration of the collection, and a variety of user interfaces can be built by using these methods, allowing users and administrators to browse. Once an appropriate service is found, the user might interact with the service by loading a user interface applet, attached as another attribute on the item.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997200"> </a>If a service encounters some problem that needs administrative attention, such as a printer running out of toner, the service can add an attribute that indicates what the problem is. Administrators again use the event mechanism to receive notification of such problems.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="997207"> </a>LU.1.2	 Attributes
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997454"> </a>The attributes of a service item are represented as a set of attribute sets. An individual <em class="Emphasis">attribute set</em> is represented as an instance of some class for the Java platform, each attribute being a public field of that class. The class provides strong typing of both the set and the individual attributes. A service item can contain multiple instances of the same class with different attribute values, as well as multiple instances of different classes. For example, an item might have multiple instances of a <code>Name</code> class, each giving the common name of the service in a different language, plus an instance of a <code>Location</code> class, an <code>Owner</code> class, and various service-specific classes. The schema used for attributes is not constrained by this specification, but a standard foundation schema for Jini technology-enabled systems is defined in the <em class="Emphasis">Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Lookup Attribute Schema Specification</em>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="997218"> </a>Concretely, a set of attributes is implemented with a class that correctly implements the interface <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</code>, as described in the <em><a href="entry-spec.html#30282">Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Entry Specification</em></a>. Operations on the lookup service are defined in terms of template matching, using the same semantics as in the <em><a href="entry-spec.html#30282">Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Entry Specification</em></a>, but the definition is augmented to deal with sets of entries and sets of templates. A set of entries matches a set of templates if there is at least one matching entry for every template (with every entry usable as the match for more than one template).

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1021857"> </a>A service ID is a 128-bit value. Service IDs are equal (using the <code>equals</code> method) if they represent the same 128-bit value. For simplicity and reliability, service IDs are normally intended to either be built into services at manufacture/deployment-time, or generated dynamically by lookup services at registration time. As such, the <code>ServiceID</code> constructor merely takes 128 bits of data, to be computed in an implementation-dependent manner. The <code>writeBytes</code> method writes out 16 bytes in standard network byte order. The second constructor reads in 16 bytes in standard network byte order.

  <a name="1020464"> </a>The <code>register</code> method is used to register a new service and to re-register an existing service. The method is defined so that it can be used in an idempotent fashion. Specifically, if a call to <code>register</code> results in a <code>RemoteException</code> (in which case the item might or might not have been registered), the caller can simply repeat the call to <code>register</code> with the same parameters, until it succeeds.
</p>
<p class="Body">

In that case, if <code>item.service</code> does not equal (using <code>MarshalledObject.equals</code>) any existing item's service object, then a new service ID will be assigned and included in the returned <code>ServiceRegistration</code> (described in the next section). The service ID is unique over time and space with respect to all other service IDs generated by all lookup services. If <code>item.service</code> does equal an existing item's service object, the existing item is first deleted from the lookup service (even if it has different attributes) and its lease is cancelled, but that item's service ID is reused for the newly registered item.

  <a name="1020466"> </a>To re-register an existing service, or to register the service in any other lookup service, <code>item.serviceID</code> should be set to the same service ID that was returned by the initial registration. If an item is already registered under the same service ID, the existing item is first deleted (even if it has different attributes or a different service instance) and its lease is cancelled by the lookup service. Note that service object equality is not checked in this case, to allow for reasonable evolution of the service (for example, the serialized form of the stub changes or the service implements a new interface).
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020467"> </a>Any duplicate attribute sets that are included in a service item are eliminated in the stored representation of the item.

  <a name="1021822"> </a>The single-parameter form of <code>lookup</code> returns the service object (that is, just <code>ServiceItem.service)</code> from an item matching the template or <code>null</code> if there is no match. If multiple items match the template, it is arbitrary as to which service object is returned by the invocation. If the returned object cannot be deserialized, an <code>UnmarshalException</code> is thrown with the standard <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">Java RMI</span> semantics.

The return value is never <code>null</code>, and the returned items array is <code>null</code> only if <code>maxMatches</code> is zero. For each returned item, if the service object cannot be deserialized, the <code>service</code> field of the item is set to <code>null</code> and no exception is thrown.

Duplicate classes are eliminated, and the order of classes within the returned array is arbitrary. A <code>null</code> reference (not an empty array) is returned if there are no such entries or no matching items.

  <a name="1020502"> </a>The <code>getFieldValues</code> method looks at all service items that match the specified template, finds every entry (among those service items) that matches <code>tmpl.attributeSetTemplates[setIndex]</code>, and returns the set of values of the specified field of those entries. Duplicate values are eliminated, and the order of values within the returned array is arbitrary. A <code>null</code> reference (not an empty array) is returned if there are no matching items. If a returned value cannot be deserialized, that element of the returned array is set to <code>null</code> and no exception is thrown. <code>NoSuchFieldException</code> is thrown if <code>field</code> does not name a field of the entry template.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020503"> </a>The <code>getServiceTypes</code> method looks at all service items that match the specified template and, for every service item, finds the most specific type (class or interface) or types the service item is an instance of that are neither equal to, nor a superclass of, any of the service types in the template and that have names that start with the specified prefix, and returns the set of all such types. Duplicate types are eliminated, and the order of types within the returned array is arbitrary. A <code>null</code> reference (not an empty array) is returned if there are no such types. If a returned type cannot be deserialized, that element of the returned array is set to <code>null</code> and no exception is thrown.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020504"> </a>Every lookup service assigns itself a service ID when it is first created; this service ID is returned by the <code>getServiceID</code> method. (Note that this does not make a remote call.) A lookup service is always registered with itself under this service ID, and if a lookup service is configured to register itself with other lookup services, it will register with all of them using this same service ID.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020516"> </a>The <code>getLocator</code> method returns a <code>LookupLocator</code> that can be used if necessary for unicast discovery of the lookup service. The definition of this class is given in the <em><a href="discovery-spec.html#40553">Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Discovery and Join Specification</em></a>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020517"> </a>The <code>getGroups</code> method returns the set of groups that this lookup service is currently a member of.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020437"> </a>The <code>getLease</code> method returns the lease that controls the service registration, allowing the lease to be renewed or cancelled. (Note that <code>getLease</code> does not make a remote call.)
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020441"> </a>The <code>addAttributes</code> method adds the specified attribute sets (those that aren't duplicates of existing attribute sets) to the registered service item. Note that this operation has no effect on existing attribute sets of the service item and can be repeated in an idempotent fashion. <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> is thrown if the registration lease has expired or been cancelled.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1021945"> </a>The <code>modifyAttributes</code> method is used to modify existing attribute sets. The lengths of the <code>attrSetTemplates</code> and <code>attrSets</code> arrays must be equal, or <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown. The service item's attribute sets are modified as follows. For each array index <code>i</code>: if <code>attrSets[i]</code> is <code>null</code>, then every entry that matches <code>attrSetTemplates[i]</code> is deleted; otherwise, for every non-<code>null</code> field in <code>attrSets[i]</code>, the value of that field is stored into the corresponding field of every entry that matches <code>attrSetTemplates[i]</code>. The class of <code>attrSets[i]</code> must be the same as, or a superclass of, the class of <code>attrSetTemplates[i]</code>, or <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown. If the modifications result in duplicate entries within the service item, the duplicates are eliminated. An <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> is thrown if the registration lease has expired or been cancelled.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020443"> </a>Note that it is possible to use <code>modifyAttributes</code> in ways that are not idempotent. The attribute schema should be designed in such a way that all intended uses of this method can be performed in an idempotent fashion. Also note that <code>modifyAttributes</code> does not provide a means for setting a field to <code>null</code>; it is assumed that the attribute schema is designed in such a way that this is not necessary.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1020444"> </a>The <code>setAttributes</code> method deletes all of the service item's existing attributes and replaces them with the specified attribute sets. Any duplicate attribute sets are eliminated in the stored representation of the item. <code>UnknownLeaseException</code> is thrown if the registration lease has expired or been cancelled.
