<h1>The ServiceUI API Specification - Version 1.1</h1>

<h1>Revision History</h1>

<ul>
 <li>1.1a - Sat., June 4, 2005: Released 1.1a with no changes to the code or this specification other
than changing the license from the Sun Community Source License (SCSL) to Apache License, Version 2.0.
 <li>1.1 - Thu., October 14, 2002: Released 1.1beta4 as 1.1 with no changes to the code or this specification.
 <li>1.1beta4 - Thu., July 11, 2002: Made a
    1.1beta4 release in which the doPrivileged statements are removed from
    the <code>UIDescriptor.getUIFactory</code> method.
    Removed the sentence, "Because setting
    and getting the context class loader is a privileged operation, the <code>getUIFactory()</code>
    method wraps those operations in <code>AccessController.doPrivileged()</code> calls," from the
    description of <code>getUIFactory</code> in section 2 of this specification.

 <li>1.1beta3 - Thu., Mar. 7, 2002: Many changes to accompany the 1.1beta3 release
     <ul>
     <li>Added Section 9, Consistent Serialized Forms, which
     describes a slight narrowing of the contracts of the constructors of <code>UIDescriptor</code>,
     <code>Locales</code>, <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>, and <code>RequiredPackages</code>. These
     constructors are now required to copy the contents of the passed <code>Set</code> or
     <code>Map</code> to an unmodifiable version that has a consistent serialized form
     across all VMs.
     <li>Changed the implementation and contract of <code>AccessibleUI.hashcode</code>
     so that it returns the hashcode of its fully qualified <code>String</code> name, rather than
     the hashcode of its <code>Class</code> instance.
     <li>Added <code>UIDescriptorBean</code> to <code>net.jini.lookup.entry</code>, as suggested
     by the Jini Lookup Attributes Schema specification.
     <li>Theresa Gonzales edited the entire spec for English, and I went over it again after that. Lots
     of minor changes to clarify sentences, but no change in semantics.
    <li>Changed "service object" to "service proxy," to tow the line with
        commonly used Jini jargon.
    <li>Modified the Javadoc of <code>MainUI</code>,  <code>AdminUI</code>,
         and <code>AboutUI</code> to match the semantics given in the
         specification. Originally (prior to the 1.0 release), these role
         interfaces defined their role object to be exactly the service item.
         Ken Arnold requested we say that the service item must be accepted
         as the role object, which yields more flexibility. Although a
         service item is required to always work when passed as the role 
         object to factory methods for main, admin, and about UIs, other
         objects may also work. I made this change back then to the
         specification, but forgot to change the Javadoc comments. The
         specification and the Javadoc comments are now in sync.
     </ul>
 <li>1.1 - Wed., Aug. 22, 2001:
     Fixed two method names in <code>JDialogFactory</code> that were both incorrectly
     named <code>getDialog()</code>
     in ServiceUI 1.0. The methods are now correctly named <code>getJDialog()</code>.
     Added <code>serialVersionID</code>s
     to all classes in the API in order to accelerate deserialization. Improved
     javadoc comments: added missing serial, author, param, throws, and return
     tags, as well as added clarifying javadoc text where it seemed helpful.
     Added flat javadoc documentation to the end of Service UI API Specification
     to make sure the API's semantics are specified in detail in the
     specification itself. 
 <li>1.0 - Mon., Apr. 24, 2000:
     Only changed the specification's version number from 0.9.2 to 1.0 in order
     to match the version number of the code now released under the Sun
     Community Source License (SCSL). 
 <li>0.9.2 - Sun., Mar. 12, 2000:
     Fixed typo: Changed <code>Administratable</code>
     to <code>Administrable</code>.
     Fixed grammar: In last paragraph of section 3.1, changed &quot;had&quot;
     to &quot;had had.&quot; 
 <li>0.9.1 - Mon., Mar. 6, 2000:
     Only changed the specification's version number from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 to
     match the code's revised version number. Fixed some bugs in version 0.9.1
     code, which are described on the Code Access
     page: http://www.artima.com/jini/serviceui/CodeAccess.html. 
 <li>0.9.0 - Tue., Feb. 22, 2000:
     Fixed four grammar typos, without changing specification meaning. In
     section 3.2, paragraph 2, the main UI's associated service item <i>must be
     accepted</i> as the role object, rather than <i>required</i> as the role
     object. In section 3.3, paragraph 2, the admin UI's associated service
     item <i>must be accepted</i> as the role object, rather than <i>required</i>
     as the role object. In section 3.4, paragraph 2, the about UI's associated
     service item <i>must be accepted</i> as the role object, rather than <i>required</i>
     as the role object. In section 3.7, paragraph 2, changed &quot;simply
     shouldn't extend&quot; to &quot;simply shouldn't <i>in general</i>
     extend.&quot; In section 3.7, added paragraph 3, which starts,
     &quot;Nevertheless, if some party....&quot; 
 <li>0.8.1 - Wed., Feb. 9, 2000:
     In <code>MainUI</code>,
     <code>AdminUI</code>,
     and <code>AboutUI</code>,
     changed constant <code>role</code>
     to <code>ROLE</code>.
     In all factories, changed <code>toolkit</code> to <code>TOOLKIT</code> and <code>typeName</code>
     to <code>TYPE_NAME</code>.
     
 <li>0.8.0 - Tue., Feb. 8, 2000:
     One last pass. Mostly minor tweaks except for the last few sections, which
     had some major surgery. 
 <li>0.7 - Mon., Feb. 7, 2000:
     Reviewed and cleaned up a lot of text. A few sections near the end are
     still a bit rough. Will post version 0.8 tonight, which will serve as the
     starting point for the two-week ServiceUI review phase. 
 <li>0.6 - Sat., Feb. 5, 2000:
     Fleshed out remaining sections, though some of it is rough. 
 <li>0.5 - Thu., Feb. 3, 2000:
     Fleshed out material in most sections. Added a new section on third-party
     UIs. 
 <li>0.4 - Wed., Feb. 2, 2000:
     Incorporated changes decided upon with Jini architects at the 2nd meeting.
     Document now offers a good general overview. 
 <li>0.3 - Mon., Jan. 31, 2000:
     Fixed a few typos in Main UI semantics. 
 <li>0.2 - Sun., Jan. 30, 2000:
     Added introduction, revised semantics of Main/Admin/About UI roles,
     dropped <code>Flavor</code>
     and <code>FlavorSelectorUI</code>.
     
 <li>0.1 - Fri., Jan. 28, 2000:
     First version.

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Traditionally, desktop applications are designed with a built-in user
interface (UI). The code for the application's UI is often highly coupled to
the code that implements the application's functionality. Over time, tentacles
of UI code may burrow deep into functionality code, and tentacles of
functionality code may burrow back into UI code. In the traditional desktop
application, therefore, the UI code and functionality code are usually
inseparable, married for all eternity. </p>

<p>Jini's service proxy architecture encourages you to think differently about
UI and functionality: </p>

<ul>
 <li>UI and functionality should
     be separate 
 <li>Both UI and functionality are
     encapsulated in objects 
 <li>The coupling point between UI
     code and functionality code should be the service proxy interface
</ul>

<p>A Jini service proxy should represent the service's pure functionality, expressed
via the methods of its object interface. For example, the service proxy
interface for a toaster service should express or model the conceptual toaster
service's functionality -- the interface should say &quot;what it means to be a
toaster.&quot; The service proxy should not supply human access to the toaster
service; a separate UI object should provide such access. </p>

<h2>1.1. Direct-Use Clients</h2>

<p>One reason for excluding the UI from the service proxy is to enable client
programs (clients) to access the service without human intervention or
supervision. Clients written by programmers who knew about a particular service
proxy's (potentially well-known or standard) interface can interact with a
service directly. As Figure 1 shows, client code can interact directly with a
service by invoking the methods in the service proxy interface. Such a client
is called a <i>direct-use</i> client, because its programmers, based on their
knowledge of the service proxy interface, can write code that uses the service
directly via that interface. </p>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG src="images/servonly.gif">
<BR clear="all">
<STRONG>Figure 1. A "direct-use" client talks to a service through its object
interface.</STRONG>
</CENTER>

<p>Direct-use clients need not be completely devoid of a user. For example, a
user could operate a device that acts as a direct-use client in certain cases.
If the user requested that the device save some data in a file, the device
could acquire a storage service proxy and directly invoke methods on that
object to save data in a file, without further user intervention. In this case,
the user-operated device acts as a direct-use client of storage services,
because the device's programmers had prior knowledge of the storage service proxy
interface and used that knowledge to program the device to use those services
directly. </p>

<p>On the other hand, direct-use clients can also function independently of
human supervision or intervention. Such clients act as <i>autonomous agents</i>,
which decide for themselves when to enlist a service's help. When an autonomous
agent uses a service, it invokes the methods offered by the service proxy
interface directly. Thus, an autonomous agent's programmers must have prior
knowledge of the service proxy interfaces their agent uses. (Although the
human programmer actually has the prior knowledge when he or she writes the
client code, in this document the code itself will often be said to have prior
knowledge.) </p>

<h2>1.2. User Adapters</h2>

<p>When you design a Jini service, you should attempt to capture the service's
entire functionality in the service proxy interface. To access any aspect of
your service, a direct-use client should only need a reference to the service
proxy. The service proxy should not include any code that defines a user
interface to the service, just code that provides the service functionality at
the method invocation level. </p>

<p>To provide a user interface for the service, you should encapsulate the user
interface code in a separate UI object. As Figure 2 shows, a UI object grants a
user access to some aspect of a Jini service. Think of a service UI object as a
<i>user adapter</i> -- an object that <em>adapts</em> a service proxy
interface that a human user cannot interact with directly into one a human user
can interact with directly. Sitting between the service proxy interface and a
human user, a UI object can grant the user access to a service. </p>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG src="images/servnUI.gif">
<BR clear="all">
<STRONG>Figure 2. A user interacts with a service via a UI object.</STRONG>
</CENTER>

<p>A UI object can represent a graphical UI component, such as an AWT <code>Frame</code> or Swing
<code>JPanel</code>,
but doesn't necessarily need to be graphical. A UI object could also represent
a speech interface, a text interface, a speech and graphic combination, or a
3D-immersive world. (The UI object is called <i>UI object</i>, rather than <i>GUI
object </i>or <i>view object</i>, because the object represents UI components
in general, not just graphical UI components.) Any kind of Jini Service UI,
including a 3D-immersible world with speech and virtual text display, should be
represented by a UI object, which is distinct from the service proxy. </p>

<p>One advantage of this architecture, in which UI and functionality are
separated, is that you can associate multiple UIs with the same service.
Associating multiple UIs with one service lets you tailor different UIs for
clients that have particular UI capabilities, such as Swing or speech. Clients
can then choose the UI that best fits their user interface capabilities. In
addition, you may want to associate different UIs that serve different
purposes, such as a main UI or an administration UI, with a service. Often, you
may need to associate multiple UIs with one Jini service, where each UI has a
particular purpose and targets a particular set of client capabilities. </p>

<h2>1.3. Jini Service UIs</h2>

<p>This specification standardizes how UI providers associate a UI (user
adapter) object with a Jini service, and shows how client programs can find the
best-fit UI among multiple UIs associated with the same service. To associate a
UI with a Jini service, UI providers (primarily service providers, but also
possibly third parties) must supply three items: </p>

<ul>
 <li>The UI itself 
 <li>A UI factory that produces
     the UI 
 <li>A UI descriptor that
     describes the UI 
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <i>UI factory</i> is an object that has one or more
factory methods that produce and return a UI object. A <i>UI descriptor</i>, an
instance of <code>net.jini.lookup.entry.UIDescriptor</code>
(<code>UIDescriptor</code>),
serves as a container for the UI factory and other objects that describe the UI produced by the factory.
Because <code>UIDescriptor</code>
implements <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</code>
(<code>Entry</code>),
you can include a <code>UIDescriptor</code>
in a Jini service item's attribute sets array, thereby associating the UI with
the service. A UI descriptor contains four public fields: </p>

<ul>
 <li><code>factory</code>: A reference to a <code>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</code>
     that contains the UI factory object in marshalled form 
 <li><code>attributes</code>: A <code>java.util.Set</code>
     of attribute objects that describe the factory-produced UI 
 <li><code>toolkit</code>: A <code>String</code>
     that names the main package of the UI toolkit the UI requires
 <li><code>role</code>: A <code>String</code>
     that gives the fully qualified name of a Java interface type that
     represents the UI's role 
</ul>

<p>The <code>attributes</code>,
<code>toolkit</code>,
and <code>role</code>
fields' purpose is to describe the UI produced by the marshalled UI factory.
Using these fields, clients can choose from multiple UIs associated with a
service. Once they select a UI object, clients can use the other field, <code>factory</code>, to
create the object. </p>

<p>To associate a UI with a Jini service, the UI provider must first fill a UI
descriptor with a role <code>String</code>,
a toolkit <code>String</code>,
an attribute set, and a marshalled UI factory. The UI provider must then place
the UI descriptor in the attribute sets of the Jini service's service item. </p>

<p>A UI's role indicates both its purpose and its role-related semantics. Each
UI role is defined as a Java interface type, which UI objects playing that role
implement. The <code>role</code>
field references a <code>String</code>
whose value is the role interface type's fully qualified name. For example, a <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>
role UI provides general access to a service. A <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code> role
UI enables a user to administer a service. Although most UI object semantics of
interest to the client program are defined by the UI factory's return type,
some semantics may be tied to the role. For example, for a role that represents
a user dialog, the role interface might include methods that let the client
determine the dialog's result. </p>

<p>The UI descriptor's <code>attributes</code>
field holds a reference to a <code>java.util.Set</code> of serializable objects that contain
information about the UI the descriptor represents. These objects can be of any
class, so long as they are serializable. Clients can search through the
attributes set for attribute types about which they have prior knowledge. The
objects can then help the client decide whether or not to use the
descriptor-represented UI. Several attribute classes, defined in the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute</code>
package, are described later in this document. </p>

<p>The <code>toolkit</code>
field facilitates matching when querying the Jini lookup service. For example,
if a client seeks all services that have main UIs working with the Swing
toolkit, it could form a <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</code>
(<code>ServiceItem</code>)
whose <code>attributeSetTemplates</code>
array includes a UI descriptor template. If the UI descriptor template's <code>factory</code> and <code>attributes</code>
fields are set to <code>null</code>,
the <code>role</code>
field is set to <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>,
and <code>toolkit</code>
field is set to <code>javax.swing</code>,
the lookup would only return services that have at least one main UI for Swing.
</p>

<p>The <code>factory</code>
field contains the UI factory object inside a <code>MarshalledObject</code> so that you
can place the class files for the factory and the UI it produces in a different
codebase than the service item containing the UI descriptor. By placing the
class files for UI factories and UI objects in separate codebases than that of
the service item, clients can download a service item without downloading all
the JAR files containing those class files, most or all of which the client may
never use. Only if the client attempts to use a UI will it need to unmarshal
the UI factory; this would trigger the downloading of the JAR file containing
the factory class files, and possibly the class files for the factory-generated
UI. </p>

<p>To use a UI, a client program must have prior knowledge of both the UI
factory type (including, of course, the UI object type returned by its factory
methods) and the UI role type. These types define the UI object semantics,
which client programmers must understand before they can write code to interact
properly with the UI. A client doesn't need prior knowledge of all the
attributes types that appear in the attributes set. To the extent the client
has prior knowledge of the attribute types, it can use that knowledge to select
an appropriate UI from multiple UIs associated with a service. </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>2. UI Descriptors</h1>

<p>A <code>net.jini.lookup.entry.UIDescriptor</code>
(<code>UIDescriptor</code>)
is a <code>net.jini.core.lookup.Entry</code>
(<code>Entry</code>)
that enables a UI to be associated with a service in the service item's
attribute sets. A <code>UIDescriptor</code>
holds a marshalled UI factory object in the <code>factory</code> field, a role type name in the
<code>role</code>
field, a toolkit package name in the <code>toolkit</code> field, and an attribute set
that describes the factory-generated UI in the <code>attributes </code>field. </p>

<p>The <code>UIDescriptor</code>
not only houses a marshalled UI factory that produces a UI, but also describes
the produced UI to help clients decide whether or not to unmarshal the UI
factory. The UI is described in the <code>role</code>, <code>toolkit</code>, and <code>attributes</code>
fields. </p>

<p>Class <code>UIDescriptor</code>'s
public interface looks like this: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.entry;

import java.util.Set;
import java.rmi.MarshalledObject;
import java.io.IOException;

public class UIDescriptor extends net.jini.entry.AbstractEntry {

    public String role;
    public String toolkit;
    public Set attributes;
    public MarshalledObject factory;

    public UIDescriptor() {...}

    public UIDescriptor(String role, String toolkit, Set attributes,
        MarshalledObject factory) {...}

    public final Object getUIFactory(ClassLoader parentLoader)
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {...}
}
</PRE>

<p>Because the marshalled UI factory is referenced from a public field, programs
can simply invoke <code>get()</code>
directly on the marshalled object to unmarshal the factory client. Clients must
ensure, however, that the class loader that loads the class files for the UI
can also (likely via a parent class loader) load the class files of the service
proxy with which the UI will interact. The <code>UIDescriptor</code> includes a convenience
method named <code>getUIFactory()</code>
to help clients unmarshal the UI factory with the proper class loader context. </p>

<p>
The <CODE>getUIFactory()</CODE> method saves a reference
to the current context class loader, sets the context class loader
to the class loader passed as <CODE>parentLoader</CODE>, invokes
<CODE>get()</CODE> on the marshalled object, then resets the
context class loader to the saved reference before returning
the object that <CODE>get()</CODE> produces.
</p>

<p>The class loader passed to the <code>getUIFactory()</code> method in the <code>parentLoader</code>
parameter should be able to load types (classes and interfaces) needed when the
UI interacts with the <i>role object</i>, which is passed as the first
parameter to any factory method. A UI role's semantic description indicates,
among other things, what object should be passed to the factory as the role
object. For the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>
role, for example, the role object is the service item. Thus, to unmarshal a UI
factory for a main UI, the class loader passed to <code>getUIFactory()</code> should be able
to load types needed when the UI interacts with the service proxy contained in
the service item. For example,
the client could pass to <code>getUIFactory()</code>
the class loader the client previously used to load the service proxy. </p>

<p>The <code>String</code>
referenced from the <code>toolkit</code>
field (which names the main package of the primary UI toolkit) is determined by
the UI factory type. Each UI factory type's semantics should include a toolkit
string, so UI providers will know what string to put in the <code>toolkit</code> field
for their selected UI factory type. Two toolkit strings currently defined are <code>java.awt</code>, for
graphical UIs that depend on AWT but not Swing, and <code>javax.swing</code>,
for graphical UIs that depend on Swing (and AWT, since Swing is built on top
AWT). </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>3. UI Roles</h1>

<p>The <code>UIDescriptor's
role</code> field gives the fully qualified name of the interface that
represents the role of the UI the marshalled UI factory generates. If the
client program unmarshals the UI factory and invokes a factory method, the UI
the factory method returns must implement the role interface that <code>role </code>
specifies.
</p>

<p>For a client program to use a UI, the client must have prior knowledge of
the UI semantics, a portion of which the UI's role type defines. Thus, for a
client to use a UI, the client must understand the semantics of the type whose
fully qualified name appears in the <code>role</code> field of that UI's <code>UIDescriptor</code>. </p>

<p>For example, three role types defined in the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui</code> package by
the Jini Service UI Specification are <code>MainUI</code>, for a main UI to a Jini
service; <code>AdminUI</code>,
for an administration UI; and <code>AboutUI</code> for an about UI. Future incarnations of
the Jini Service UI Specification, individual Jini service API specifications,
or any other party may define other role types. The UI role types' fully
qualified names should, as with any other type, follow the recommended naming
convention for unique packages outlined in the Java Language Specification: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging
to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as sun.com. You then
reverse this name, component by component, to obtain, in this example, com.sun,
and use this as a prefix for your package names, using a convention developed
within your organization to further administer package names. </p>

<p>For example, printers in general don't have a main UI, but they may have a
UI for printer setup, a UI for print job setup, and a UI for administering the
printer. The Printer working group, therefore, could define two role types as
part of its Printer API definition, one for printer setup and one for print job
setup. (The printer's administration UI could likely use the existing <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code>
role.) The Printer working group would start its role type names with a package
prefix it has either received or obtained control over. For example, if the
Jini Community grants the Printer working group the right to place its APIs in
the <code>net.jini.print</code>
package, the group could name its <code>role</code> types: <code>net.jini.print.ui.PrinterSetup</code>
and <code>net.jini.print.ui.PrintJobSetup</code>.
Each working group or other entity that defines Jini Service APIs can include,
as part of its specification, any new UI role types useful in the context of
its service. </p>

<h2>3.1. Display Roles to Users</h2>

<p>As the strings referenced from the <code>role</code> field are Java type names, they
should only be manipulated by client programs. Users should not view them. A
client may, nevertheless, display localized strings representing roles about
which the client has prior knowledge. </p>

<p>For example, imagine a Jini browser client shows a service list using icons
and names provided by <code>net.jini.lookup.entry.ServiceType</code>
(<code>ServiceType</code>)
entries. Such a Jini browser could, when the user double-clicks on a service
icon or name, attempt to display a <code>MainUI</code> for the service. In addition,
such a Jini browser could, when the user right-clicks on a service icon or
name, pop up a list of verb strings, one for each UI role the service offers in
a form the client believes it can use. For example, imagine that the user
right-clicked, among the UIs offered by the service, three <code>java.swing.JFrame</code>
(<code>JFrame</code>)
UIs (produced by <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JFrameFactory</code>s);
one for each of <code>net.jini.lookup.ui</code>
package's three defined roles: <code>MainUI</code>, <code>AdminUI</code>, and <code>AboutUI</code>. If
the client can use <code>JFrame</code>s,
the client could display three verbs on the pop-up list when the user
right-clicks. In the US-English locale, the verb strings could be: <code>&quot;Open...&quot;</code>,
<code>&quot;Administer...&quot;</code>,
and <code>&quot;About...&quot;</code>.
If the user selects <code>About...</code>,
the client could display the <code>AboutUI</code> <code>JFrame</code>. </p>

<p>Note that the service did not provide the strings shown to the user -- <code>&quot;Open...&quot;</code>,
<code>&quot;Administer...&quot;</code>,
and <code>&quot;About...&quot;</code>.
The developers of the Jini browser client decided upon these strings. Given
that these developers had prior knowledge of the <code>MainUI</code> role, they were able to
decide that, in their client, <code>&quot;Open&quot;</code> would be a sensible verb string
for <code>MainUI</code>s
in the US-English locale. Of course, those developers may have selected other
verb strings for other locales. German users of the same browser, for example,
could potentially encounter the verb string <code>&quot;Jetzt Geht's Los...&quot;</code> for <code>MainUI</code>s, <code>&quot;Was Ist Das
Ding...&quot;</code> for <code>AboutUI</code>s, and <code>&quot;Spielen Sie Mit Die Viele Kleine Nummern...&quot;</code>
for <code>AdminUI</code>s.
</p>

<p>Because the client program, not the Jini service, provides the verb strings,
the client will be unable to show a verb in its list for any role about which
it did not have prior knowledge. Thus, if the user right-clicks a service that
also offers a <code>JFrame</code>
UI with the role <code>net.jini.blender.ui.FrappeUI</code>,
the client will be able to display a localized string for that UI in its verb
list only if the client's developers had had prior knowledge of that role. If
the client's programmers did not endow the program with prior knowledge of <code>FrappeUI</code>s, the
client will not be able to list a verb for that UI in its pop-up, and therefore
the user will not be able to select it. This prior-knowledge requirement is
intentional, because as mentioned previously, the role defines a portion of the
UI's semantics. Before the client program can properly use a UI, it must have
prior knowledge of the role interface. If a client doesn't know how to use a
UI, then letting the user select that UI makes no sense.</p>

<h2>3.2. The <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>
Role</h2>

<p><code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>
(<code>MainUI</code>)
is a UI role interface implemented by main UIs, which enable client programs to
grant users general access to a service. If a UI descriptor's UI factory
produces a UI that implements this interface (i.e., produces a main UI), the UI
descriptor's <code>role</code>
field must reference a <code>String</code>
with the value <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>.
</p>

<p>The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is a
role object. Any factory method that produces a main UI must accept as the role
object the service item (the <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</code>) of the service
associated with the main UI. </p>

<p>Main UIs should let clients configure them before they begin. For example,
main UIs produced by <code>FrameFactory</code>,
<code>JFrameFactory</code>,
<code>WindowFactory</code>
and <code>JWindowFactory</code>
(all members of the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</code>
package) should not be visible when they return from the factory method. This
allows clients to set the UI's position and size, for example, before making
the UI visible by invoking <code>setVisible(true)</code> on the UI. </p>

<p>A client should be able to invoke a main UI factory method multiple times
sequentially. In other words, if a user uses a service via a main UI, then
exits, and then double-clicks once again on the service icon, the client can
simply invoke a UI factory method again, and acquire another main UI for the
same service. Therefore, you should write main UIs so that they work regardless
of the service proxy's state when the main UI is created. </p>

<p>It is recommended that clients use multiple main UIs for the same service
only sequentially, and avoid creating for the same service proxy multiple main
UIs that operate concurrently with one another. But because some clients may
create and use multiple main UIs simultaneously for the same service proxy,
service and main UI providers should program defensively to ensure that
multiple main UIs for the same service proxy will all work together
concurrently. </p>

<p>Here's the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</code>
tag interface: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui;

public interface MainUI {

    String ROLE = "net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI";
}
</PRE>

<h2>3.3. The <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code>
Role</h2>

<p><code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code>
(<code>AdminUI</code>)
is a UI role interface implemented by admin UIs, which enable users to
administer a service. If a UI descriptor's UI factory produces a UI that implements
this interface (i.e., produces an admin UI), the UI descriptor's <code>role</code> field must reference a <code>String</code>
with the value <code>&quot;net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI&quot;</code>.
</p>

<p>The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is a
role object. Any factory method that produces an admin UI must accept as the
role object the service item (the <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</code>) of
the service associated with the main UI. </p>

<p>Admin UIs have precisely the same semantics as main UIs. The only difference
is their purpose. Here's the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code> interface: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui;

public interface AdminUI {

    String ROLE = "net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI";
}
</PRE>

<h2>3.4. The <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI</code>
Role</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI</code>
(<code>AboutUI</code>)
is a UI role interface implemented by about UIs, which enable users to view (or
in some way experience) information about a service. If a UI descriptor's UI
factory produces a UI that implements this interface (i.e., produces an about
UI), the UI descriptor's <code>role</code>
field must reference a <code>String</code>
with the value <code>&quot;net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI&quot;</code>.
</p>

<p>The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is a
role object. Any factory method that produces an about UI must accept as the
role object the service item (the <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</code>) of
the service associated with the main UI. </p>

<p>About UIs have precisely the same semantics as main UIs. The only difference
is their purpose. Here's the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI</code> interface: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui;

public interface AboutUI {

    String ROLE = "net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI";
}
</PRE>

<h2>3.5. Defining New Role Types</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, any party may define new role interfaces. New UI
role interfaces will likely be defined in conjunction with new Jini Service API
definitions, and many of those roles will likely represent service-specific
dialogs with users. As used here, a <i>dialog</i> is a short conversation with
the user, usually to obtain some information from the user. Although for
graphical toolkits, a dialog is often implemented with a dialog box, such as
AWT's <code>Dialog</code>
or Swing's <code>JDialog</code>,
the term <i>dialog</i> is used here in the generic sense, not strictly in the
graphical sense. Service-specific dialog UIs will enable clients to enlist a
user's help at various points throughout an otherwise direct use of a service. </p>

<p>As an example, consider a user asking a word processor that has prior
knowledge of a well-known Jini Printer API to print a document. (Note that the
types appearing in this example were invented for illustration purposes. At the
time of this writing, the Jini Printer Service API had not been finalized.) To
print via the Jini Print Service API, the word processor first obtains a <code>net.jini.print.service.PrintService</code>
(<code>PrintService</code>)
object and invokes <code>createPrintJob()</code>
on that object to obtain a <code>net.jini.print.job.PrintJob</code> (<code>PrintJob</code>)
object. A purely direct-use client must do two things with the <code>PrintJob</code>
object -- configure the print job and supply the print data -- before invoking <code>close()</code> on the
print job, thereby queuing the printing job. Although the word processor could
potentially do both jobs directly, it may not have prior knowledge of the portion of the <code>PrintJob</code>
object's interface that lets the client configure the print job, and besides,
users are accustomed to configuring print jobs. Given an available user, the
word processor would likely want to provide a dialog UI that lets the user
configure the print job. Once the user completes his or her configuration and
dismisses the dialog UI (with &quot;OK,&quot; not &quot;Cancel&quot;), the word
processor could supply the print data and invoke <code>close()</code> on the <code>PrintJob</code>. </p>

<p>Given that Jini Print Service API clients would prefer a dialog UI that
allows for user configuration, the Printer working group could define a new UI
role type for that purpose. The Printer working group would likely place the
role interface in some subpackage of its API's main package. For example, it
could define an interface named: <code>net.jini.print.ui.PrintJobSetup</code> (<code>PrintJobSetup</code>).
</p>

<p>A <code>PrintJobSetup</code>
UI would represent a dialog that enables user configuration of a print job,
such as page orientation, and so on. Once the user selects configuration
parameters, he or she dismisses the dialog UI, which in some way communicates
back to the client those parameters (likely by invoking methods on the <code>PrintJob</code>
object itself, which is likely the role object for the <code>PrintJobSetup</code>
role) and indicates to the client that the dialog is finished. The <code>PrintJobSetup</code>
interface's semantics would define how the client interacts with the UI, such
as how the client knows the UI has been dismissed, and whether or not the user
dismissed the UI with &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel.&quot; If the client
receives &quot;OK,&quot; the client could then write print data to the <code>PrintJob</code>
object and invoke <code>close()</code>
on the <code>PrintJob</code>,
thereby sending it to the printer. </p>

<p>The semantics of the <code>PrintJobSetup</code>
role interface defines the way in which the <code>PrintJobSetup</code> UI interacts with the
client (i.e., communicates the configuration data and indicates the dialog's
dismissal). As the dialog may require sophisticated UI and client interaction,
the role interface may be more than just a tag interface; it may include
methods that define how the UI and client interact. The word processor client
would know how to display this <code>PrintJobSetup</code> dialog because the <code>PrintJobSetup</code>
role interface, and its semantics, would be defined in the Jini Print Service
API, of which that client has prior knowledge. </p>

<h2>3.6. Working with Existing Role Types</h2>

<p>Besides creating new role types for service-specific dialogs, a working
group for a Jini service API or a provider of a Jini service API implementation
could also provide multiple incarnations of an already-defined role. For
example, what if the manufacturer of a combined printer/scanner/faxer/copier
product (a &quot;four-in-one box&quot;) wanted to deliver four <code>AdminUI</code>s, each
dedicated to administering one of four product functions? Such a manufacture
could take several approaches. </p>

<p>First, assuming the Jini Community has adopted a standard API for each
product function (i.e., a Jini Print Service API, a Jini Scanner Service API, a
Jini Faxer Service API, and a Jini Copier Service API), the four-in-one-box
manufacturer could, rather than registering one Jini service whose service
proxy implements four interfaces (such as <code>Printer</code>, <code>Scanner</code>, <code>Faxer</code>, and <code>Copier</code>),
simply offer four separate Jini services, each of which implements only one
interface. In this approach, each service could offer an <code>AdminUI</code>
dedicated to that one function. </p>

<p>Alternatively (or in addition), the manufacturer could register one Jini
service whose service proxy implements all four interfaces. The <code>AdminUI</code> for
that service could present a user interface device (such as a tabbed pane for a
graphical UI) that lets users select between the four main functions. In this
way, one <code>AdminUI</code>
exists, which grants users access to the four conceptual administration UIs. </p>

<p>Lastly, the manufacturer could propose to the Jini Community a Jini
Four-in-One Service API that includes four new role types, each dedicated to
administering a product subset. The Four-in-One working group, which defines
the Jini Four-in-One Service API, could control a package that holds the role
types, <code>PrinterAdminUI</code>,
<code>ScannerAdminUI</code>,
<code>FaxerAdminUI</code>,
and <code>CopierAdminUI</code>.
Clients with prior knowledge of the Jini Four-in-One Service API would also
have prior knowledge of the four role types, and therefore could offer verb
strings for them. Four-in-One service providers could offer those four admin UI
types, but should also offer a basic <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</code>, which as
described previously, grants a user access to all four admin UIs. Including an <code>AdminUI</code> lets
clients that don't have prior knowledge of the Four-in-One service to offer a
UI that will let users administer that service. </p>

<h2>3.7. Choosing Superinterfaces for New Role Types</h2>

<p>In general, role interfaces should not extend other role interfaces, because
only one role interface is described in the UI descriptor's <code>role</code> field.
For example, the <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>
from the previous section appears to be able to extend <code>AdminUI</code>,
because you could consider a <code>FaxerAdminUI</code> to be an <code>AdminUI</code>
type.
However, only one role interface can appear in the UI descriptor's <code>role</code> field. If
a UI is both a <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>
and an <code>AdminUI</code>,
then which role goes into the <code>role</code> field? If the same UI registers twice, once
with <code>AdminUI</code>
and once with <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>,
then what is the point of <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>?
In other words, if a <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>
is the default admin UI of the four, then the Four-in-One working group wouldn't
need to define a <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>
in the first place. They would only need to mention that an <code>AdminUI</code> should
behave as an admin UI for the fax machine. </p>

<p>Role interfaces can extend other interfaces; in general, they simply
shouldn't extend other role interfaces. If a dialog UI role's semantics are
already defined in an interface, then the role interface could extend that
interface and thereby inherit those methods and semantics. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a party decides to create a role interface that extends
another role interface, any factory method that generates the subinterface UI
role type must accept the same role object categories accepted by factory
methods that generate the superinterface UI role type. For example, if <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>
were declared as an <code>AdminUI</code>
subinterface, any factory method that produces a <code>FaxerAdminUI</code> would have to accept
as the role object the <code>FaxerAdminUI</code>-associated
service item, because factory methods that produce <code>AdminUI</code>s
accept that role object category. </p>

<p>It is recommended that all role interfaces include a compile time <code>String</code>
constant named <code>ROLE</code>,
which gives the UI role interface's fully qualified string type name, as it
should appear in UI descriptor's <code>role</code> fields. Such convenience
constants not only help reduce typing and increase code readability, they also
leverage compile-time type checking to help minimize the chance of
typographical errors in <code>role</code>
strings. </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>4. UI Attributes</h1>

<p>The UI descriptor's <code>attributes</code>
field references a <code>java.util.Set</code>
of objects that describe the UI generated by the marshalled UI factory. Any
object can appear in this set, so long as it is serializable. (Note that if any
object in this set is not serializable, the entire set will not appear at the
client side -- the UI descriptor's <code>attributes</code> field will be <code>null</code>.) </p>

<p>If a UI provider wishes to register a UI descriptor that has no attributes,
it may register the UI descriptor with either a reference to an empty <code>java.util.Set</code>
or <code>null</code>
in the UI descriptor's <code>attributes</code>
field. Nevertheless, because clients would know little about the UI represented
by that UI descriptor, many clients would likely ignore the descriptor
entirely. </p>

<p>Although all attributes are optional, this specification recommends that all
UI descriptors include at least the attributes (all of which are members of the
<code>net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute</code>
package) described in this list: </p>

<ul>
 <li>If (and only if) the UI
     supports the accessibility API, one <code>AccessibleUI</code> attribute 
 <li>One <code>Locales</code>
     attribute: Lists the locales the UI supports 
 <li>One <code>RequiredPackages</code>
     attribute: Lists packages the UI requires to be installed at the client
 <li>One <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
     attribute: Lists Java types of which the marshalled UI factory is an
     instance
</ul>

<p>The remainder of this section describes these four attribute classes in
detail. </p>

<h2>4.1. The <code>AccessibleUI</code>
Attribute</h2>

<p><code>AccessibleUI</code>
indicates that a generated UI implements the <code>javax.accessibility.Accessible</code>
interface and that the UI's designer made sure the UI would work well with Java
Accessibility API-aware assistive technologies. </p>

<p>The attribute should appear in a <code>UIDescriptor</code>'s attributes set only if
the marshalled UI factory produces an Accessibility API-supported UI. This
attribute's presence in an attributes set means the produced UI will work well
with Java Accessibility API-aware assistive technologies. </p>

<p>The <code>AccessibleUI</code>
attribute looks like this: </p>


<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute;

public class AccessibleUI implements java.io.Serializable {
}
</PRE>

<h2>4.2. The <code>Locales</code>
Attribute</h2>

<p>
The <code> Locales</code>
attribute lists locales supported by a generated UI. </p>

<p>Zero to many <code>Locales</code>
instances may appear in a UI descriptor's attributes set. UI providers are encouraged to
provide in any UI descriptor's attributes set one <code>Locales</code> object that contains the
complete set of locales supported by the UI. Given that UI providers are not required
to give complete or even accurate information about locales, clients should
program defensively and consider the supported locales a strong hint that
locales are supported by the UI, but not necessarily 100 percent complete or accurate.
</p>

<P>
The public interface of <CODE>Locales</CODE> looks like this:

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute;

import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.List;

public class Locales implements java.io.Serializable {

    public Locales(Set locales) {...}
    public boolean isLocaleSupported(Locale locale) {...}
    public Locale getFirstSupportedLocale(Locale[] locales) {...}
    public Locale getFirstSupportedLocale(List locales) {...}
    public Iterator iterator() {...}
    public Set getLocales() {...}
}
</PRE>

<h2>4.3. The <code>RequiredPackages</code>
Attribute</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><code>RequiredPackages</code>
lets clients obtain a list of fully qualified names and version numbers of
packages a UI requires. </p>

<p>Zero to many <code>RequiredPackages</code>
attributes may appear in a <code>UIDescriptor</code><code>'s</code><code> </code>attributes
set. Client programs interested in a UI may wish to verify that they have all
required packages mentioned in the <code>RequiredPackages</code> attributes (if any)
before they attempt to create the UI. If the client lacks any required packages
(either because the package is absent or because the package is incompatible),
the client will not be able to use the UI. </p>

<p>This attribute intends to provide a quick way for a client program to
determine that a client cannot use a UI, not to guarantee that a client can
definitely use a UI. If a client is missing a required package, or has an
incompatible version, the client cannot use the UI. But if the client has
compatible versions of all required packages, the client may or may not be able
to use the UI. </p>

<p>UI providers should attempt to list in a <code>RequiredPackages</code> attribute all
packages that must be installed at the client for the UI to work. In this case,
if the client has compatible versions of all listed packages and attempts to
generate the UI via the factory method, the client will likely succeed. (Note
that packages used by the UI that could potentially be installed at the client,
but are also available at the UI's or service's codebase, should not be listed
in a <code>RequiredPackages</code>
attribute. The client does not actually require such packages, because if the
client doesn't have them, it can download the packages.) </p>

<p>Client programmers should bear in mind that a <code>RequiredPackages</code> attribute
doesn't necessarily list <em>all</em> required packages. As a result,
satisfying all required packages doesn't guarantee the UI will work on the
client. Client programs should therefore program defensively. (For example,
clients should probably catch <code>LinkageError</code> in appropriate places when dealing
with UIs, even if they have compatible versions of all required packages.) </p>

<p>The version numbers listed in <code>RequiredPackages</code> attributes must take
the form of specification version numbers, as used by the <code>java.lang.Package</code>
class: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>Specification version numbers use a &quot;Dewey
Decimal&quot; syntax that consists of positive decimal integers separated by
periods &quot;.&quot;, for example, &quot;2.0&quot; or
&quot;1.2.3.4.5.6.7&quot;. This allows an extensible number to be used to
represent major, minor, micro, etc versions. The version number must begin with
a number. </p>

<p>Here's what the <code>RequiredPackages</code>'s
public interface looks like: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class RequiredPackages implements java.io.Serializable {

    public RequiredPackages(Map packages) {...}
    public Iterator iterator() {...}
    public String getVersion(String packageName) {...}
    public Map getRequiredPackages() {...}
}
</PRE>

<h2>4.4. The <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
Attribute</h2>

<p><code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
allows client programs to determine Java types of which a UI factory (marshalled
in the same <code>UIDescriptor</code>)
is an instance. </p>

<p>Zero to many <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
may appear in the UI descriptor's attributes set. The marshalled UI factory in
a UI descriptor's <code>factory</code> field should be an instance of
each type that appears in any <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
attribute in that UI descriptor's <code>attributes</code> set. 
</p>

<p>Of all attributes that could appear in the attributes set, <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
is perhaps the most important. If a UI descriptor's attributes set includes no <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
attribute, then the only way for clients to know what kind of factory a UI
descriptor represents is to unmarshal it. But unmarshalling a UI factory will
likely involve downloading code, which a client wants to avoid unless it is
fairly certain it can use the UI. As a result, UI providers are strongly
encouraged to include in every UI descriptor a <code>UIFactoryTypes</code> attribute that
includes those Java types (of which the UI factory is an instance) that clients
would likely be searching for. In general, clients will be looking for
well-known factory interface types, such as those appearing in the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</code>
package. </p>

<P>
The public interface of <CODE>UIFactoryTypes</CODE> looks like this:

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute;

import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class UIFactoryTypes implements java.io.Serializable {

    public Types(Set typeNames) {...}
    public boolean isAssignableTo(Class classObj) {...}
    public Iterator iterator() {...}
    public Set getTypeNames() {...}
}
</PRE>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>5. UI Factories</h1>

<p>The UI factory object should implement one or more UI factory interfaces
appropriate to the type of UI generated (the factory method's return value) and
the options clients have at creation time (the parameters the client can and
must pass to the factory method). Factory interfaces can be implemented in many
ways, but in general, factory objects should use lazy instantiation of the UI object.
For example, rather than instantiating a UI object when the factory
instantiates, and returning that already-instantiated UI when a factory method
is invoked, a factory object should wait until a factory method is actually
invoked before instantiating the UI object. Lazy instantiation lets you marshal
the factory object without requiring the UI object's image to be included in
the UI factory's marshalled image. </p>

<p>UI factories define methods that indicate by their return type the generated
UI's Java type and indicate by their parameters the objects and primitive
values that the client can and must supply to the factory. The first parameter
to any UI factory method is a role object. The UI's role determines this
object's category (but not the type). As used here, <i>category</i> means how
the client program obtains the role object. For example, a role might specify
that its role object is the service item, the service proxy, or an object
obtained by invoking a method on the service proxy. The UI role describes how
the client acquires the object that must be passed as the first parameter to
the factory method. For example, the <code>MainUI</code> role's semantics indicate that
the role object is the service item. </p>

<p>You should write UI factories such that their factory methods can be invoked
multiple times. A client may wish to show a user the same UI several times, and
therefore may invoke a factory method on the same factory object multiple
times. Each time the factory method is invoked, it should produce and return a
new UI object copy. </p>

<p>The Jini Service UI API's first version defines eight factory interfaces: </p>

<ul>
 <li><code>DialogFactory</code>: Returns an
     instance of class <code>java.awt.Dialog</code>,

</ul>

<p>Future incarnations of the Jini Service UI Specification or any other party
may define additional UI factory interface types. The fully qualified names of
UI factory interface types should, as with any other type, follow the
recommended naming convention for unique packages outlined in the Java Language
Specification: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>You form a unique package name by first having (or
belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as
sun.com. You then reverse this name, component by component, to obtain, in this
example, com.sun, and use this as a prefix for your package names, using a
convention developed within your organization to further administer package
names. </p>

<p>Here's an example UI factory interface: </p>

<PRE>
package net.jini.lookup.ui.factory;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public interface JFrameFactory extends java.io.Serializable {

    String TOOLKIT = "javax.swing";
    String TYPE_NAME = "net.jini.lookup.ui.factory.JFrameFactory";

    JFrame getJFrame(Object roleObject);
}
</PRE>

<p>Given that only one toolkit field exists, all <code>UIFactory</code> interfaces implemented
by a UI factory class must have the same toolkit. </p>

<h2>5.1. Defining New Factory Types</h2>

<p>Although anyone can define new factory types, to prevent a chaotic explosion
of factory types, you should define new factory types with the utmost care. In
general, new factory types will be justified only when new UI toolkits appear
on the scene. If possible, new factory types should be agreed upon by the Jini
Community and placed into the <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</code> package so they are easy
to find. For example, if a toolkit is defined for speech-only UIs, a set of
factory methods for speech-only UIs could be added to those already in <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</code>.
If a graphical toolkit is defined for extremely small screens, a set of factory
methods for small-screen UIs could be added to those already in <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</code>.
</p>

<p>A UI factory must be an interface, and each method in the interface must
take an <code>Object</code>
called the <code>roleObject</code>
as its first parameter. Other than the role object, nothing should be passed to
a factory method except information or context required by the toolkit. </p>

<p>It is recommended that all UI factory interfaces include two compile time <code>String</code>
constants: </p>

<ul>
 <li><code>TOOLKIT</code>: Gives the package
     name of the produced UI's toolkit, which should appear in the UI descriptor's
     <code>toolkit</code>
     field 
 <li><code>TYPE_NAME</code>: Gives the fully
     qualified string type name of the UI factory, as it should appear in <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
     attributes 
</ul>

<p>Such convenience constants not only help reduce typing and increase code
readability, they also leverage compile-time type checking to help minimize the
chance of typographical errors in <code>toolkit</code> strings and type names added
to <code>UIFactoryTypes</code>
attributes. </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>6. UI Objects</h1>

<p>UI objects should be user adapters, as shown in Figure 2. Two temptations
that service and UI providers may have are: </p>

<ul>
 <li>Put UI code in the service
     proxy 
 <li>Put service code in the UI
     object 
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both temptations should be avoided. The Jini service proxy
should contain the service functionality, the whole service functionality, and
nothing but the service functionality. No user-interface code should appear in
the service proxy, and no service functionality should appear in the UI object
unless it also appears in the service proxy. In short, Jini Service UIs should
merely offer users all or part of the functionality available to direct-use
clients via the Jini service proxy's methods. </p>

<p>Note that even though the service item may be passed as the role object for
some roles -- as it is to factories that produce <code>MainUI</code>s, <code>AdminUI</code>s, and <code>AboutUI</code>s --
the full service <em>functionality</em> should nevertheless be available
exclusively through the service proxy. The service item may be passed as the
role object to UI factories because extra information (but not extra
functionality) could exist elsewhere in the service item, in the service ID
or attribute sets, and the UI may wish to display that extra information to
the user. </p>

<p>It is strongly encouraged that service and UI providers decouple the class
files required by a particular service item from the class files required by any
UIs associated with that service via UI descriptors in the service item. If the
class files for the service item and those of all service-associated UIs via UI
descriptors are placed into the same JAR file, then a client must download all
class files for all UIs just to download the service item, even if the client
never uses a single UI. </p>

<h2>6.1. What to Provide</h2>

<p>This specification does not mandate any UI types to be associated with
services. Service providers are free to provide any types of UI, or no UIs, with
their services. Nevertheless, some discussion of client expectations may help
service providers decide what UI types to supply. </p>

<p>First, if a service provider only supplies one UI, it should likely be an
embeddable component, such as an AWT <code>Panel</code> or Swing <code>JComponent</code>.
Although Swing UIs can be more attractive than AWT UIs, an AWT <code>Panel</code> may
allow the greatest reach with one UI type. </p>

<p>A <code>Panel</code>
allows clients to show a UI without another pop-up window, whether they support
AWT or Swing. If a client wants to pop up a UI, it can embed a <code>Panel</code> UI in a
new <code>Frame</code>
and pop that up. If a client wants to display a <code>Panel</code> title and icon, it can use the
localized name and icon provided by a <code>ServiceType</code>. </p>

<p>A <code>Panel</code>
doesn't usually provide an exit for the client, and a menu bar at the top of a <code>Panel</code>
is uncommon.
So as a UI provider, you may also want to provide either a <code>Frame</code> or a <code>Window</code> in
which <code>Panel</code> is placed
and add other UI elements, such as menu bar, status bar, and title. If you take
this approach, one factory object could implement both the <code>PanelFactory</code>
and the <code>FrameFactory</code>
interfaces, because their toolkit is the same. This might make sense if the <code>Panel</code> is used
in the <code>Frame</code>,
and the <code>Frame</code>
doesn't require many classes not already used by the panel. Alternatively, you could produce the <code>Panel</code> and <code>Frame</code> by two
different UI factories sitting in two different UI descriptors. </p>

<p>You may also wish to support Swing in addition to, or instead of,
AWT. If so, at a minimum a Swing <code>JComponent</code> UI, or a <code>JComponent</code>
with either a <code>JFrame</code>
or a <code>JWindow, </code>may
be more suitable. If you take the second approach, one factory object could
implement both the <code>JComponentFactory</code>
and the <code>JFrameFactory</code>
interfaces, because their toolkit is the same. Alternatively, two different UI
factories sitting in two different UI descriptors could produce the <code>JComponent</code> and
<code>JFrame</code>.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, for those UI roles that represent user dialogs, an AWT <code>Dialog</code> or
Swing <code>JDialog</code>
may be more appropriate. </p>

<p>Currently no direct support exists in the Jini Service UI API for
speech-only interfaces, but an AWT or Swing UI could be enhanced with speech
capabilities, produced by an appropriate AWT or Swing UI factory type, and
identified as speech-enabled with the appropriate required package names (such
as <code>javax.speech</code>)
in the <code>RequiredPackages</code>
attribute. If a speech-enhanced GUI is provided, a GUI-only version should also
be provided, as many clients won't have speech capabilities. </p>

<h2>6.2. Avoid Service-Level Data and Client Context</h2>

<p>Service-level data and client-context data are two data types you may be tempted
to pass to UI objects, either directly or via factory methods (which may then
tempt you to define new factories). It is strongly recommended that you avoid
both temptations. </p>

<p>For example, imagine a service provider requires a user name and password for
its service. The service provider wants clients to be able to save a user's
name and password locally and enter them automatically the next time the user
uses the service. If no user name and password were previously saved, the
service UI would prompt the user to type them into a logon dialog box. But if
the user name and password were saved, the user would never see the logon
dialog box. Rather, the client program would log on automatically with the
saved user name and password, and display to the user only the service UI that
appears after a successful logon. </p>

<p>To implement this functionality, a service provider might be tempted to
define interfaces that allow the client to pass a saved user name and password
to the UI. Alternatively, a service provider might be tempted to define new
factory methods that enable clients to pass a user name and password to the
factory, which could then send them to the UI. </p>

<p>
The trouble with either of these approaches is that functionality is being put into the UI that isn't in the service. 
As mentioned previously, a Jini service's
functionality should be modeled in the service proxy, so direct-use client
code can just use the service directly. If a service requires a user name and
password, the service proxy's interface should allow the client to provide the
user name and password. Thus, a client with a user could give the user name and
password to the service proxy first, then create the UI. The UI could ask the
service proxy if it has a user name and password yet. If not, the UI would
show the logon dialog box prompting for the user name and password. Otherwise,
the UI wouldn't show the logon dialog box. </p>

<p>The recommended way to design a Jini service and its UIs is to make sure the
full functionality is available via the service proxy interface, and keep the
UIs focused on being user adapters -- adapting some or all functionality
available via the service proxy interface, but offering no more functionality
available via the service proxy interface. </p>

<p>Service providers are not the only Jini Community members who will face
UI-related temptations in the years ahead; client providers may also be tempted
to pass client context data to UI objects. </p>

<p>For example, a client provider wishing to differentiate his or her product
from the competition might add a toolbar and status bar to the client program.
The client provider might be tempted to define interfaces that allow the client
to pass references to the toolbar and status bar to the UI. Alternatively, the
client might be tempted to define new factory interfaces whose factory methods
include parameters that allow the client to pass references to the toolbar and
status bar to the factory, which could then pass it along to the UI. UIs that
obtain references to the toolbar and status bar in either of these two ways
could then put buttons on the toolbar and write messages to the status bar. </p>

<p>The trouble lurking behind this seemingly innocuous value-add is that the
toolbar and status bar references represent client context data, which complicates
the UI providers' jobs. If other clients devise their own toolbar and status
bar interfaces, and perhaps even up the ante by also defining other client
context innovations, UI providers will have to worry about which kinds of
client context to support. To the extent a UI provider supports various kinds
of client context, that UI provider's test matrix will expand. To the extent
that client context becomes complicated, such as the invention of a general
compound document model for Jini Service UIs, everyone's job, and the user's
experience, become more complicated. </p>

<p>Client providers, therefore, should avoid the temptation to invent client
context for Jini Service UIs. The only context data that should be passed to UI
factory methods is context a UI toolkit requires, such as the <code>Frame</code> or <code>Window</code>
reference required by an AWT <code>Dialog</code>. Similarly, the only context in which Jini
Service UIs should be embedded is context the toolkit provides. For example, a
client could embed a Jini Service UI <code>JComponent</code> in a <code>JFrame</code>, and
then pop up the <code>JFrame</code>.
The <code>JComponent</code>'s ability to embed
is provided by its toolkit, Swing. </p>

<p>UI providers can do their part by ensuring that their UIs don't depend on
any context other than that provided by the UI toolkit. Jini Service UIs should
be self-contained and care only about the context of their toolkit. If a UI
provider wants its UI to write messages to a status bar, the UI should not look
for a status bar provided by the client, the UI should itself include a status
bar. </p>

<h1>7. Add Third-Party UIs</h1>

<p>To add a third-party UI to an existing service's attribute sets, you must
have the service's cooperation. The service can veto your request at any of
several points in the process. The steps are: </p>

<ol>
 <li>Check to see if the service
     proxy implements <code>net.jini.admin.Administrable</code>
     (<code>Administrable</code>).
     
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:1.0in'>If the service proxy does not implement <code>Administrable</code>,
the service provider has already thwarted your wishes. You won't be able to add
a third-party UI directly to the service item's attribute sets. </p>

<ol>
 <li>Cast the service proxy to <code>Administrable</code>
     and invoke <code>getAdmin()</code>.
     
 <li>Check to see if the admin
     object returned by <code>getAdmin()</code>
     implements the <code>net.jini.admin.JoinAdmin</code>
     (<code>JoinAdmin</code>).
     
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:1.0in'>If the admin object does not implement <code>JoinAdmin</code>, the
service provider has thwarted your wishes. You won't be able to add a
third-party UI directly to the service item's attribute sets. </p>

<ol>
 <li>Cast the service proxy to <code>JoinAdmin</code>,
     and invoke appropriate methods to add or modify one or more <code>UIDescriptor</code>s.
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:1.0in'>You add or modify <code>UIDescriptor</code>s in the same manner as
you would add or modify any kind of <code>Entry</code> in the service's attribute sets.
The <code>JoinAdmin</code>'s
<code>addLookupAttribute()</code>
method lets you add new <code>UIDescriptor</code>s.
Its <code>modifyLookupAttribute()</code>
method lets you modify existing <code>UIDescriptor</code>s. Once again, the service provider
can veto your request, even at this step, by throwing an exception from these
methods. </p>

<p>Once a new <code>UIDescriptor</code>
for a third-party UI is successfully added via the process described
previously, the third party won't need to add it again. From that point
forward, whenever a service registers itself with a lookup service, its service
item will include the third-party <code>UIDescriptor</code>. It will also reregister
itself with any lookup services with which it is currently registered, so that
the new <code>UIDescriptor</code>
will appear there as well. Even if the service provider crashes and restarts,
it should remember the new <code>UIDescriptor</code> and include it in its registrations
after the crash and restart. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the UI, UI factory, and possibly the attributes require
class files to be available in some codebase. Although the third party never
needs to worry about the <code>UIDescriptor</code>
being included in future service registrations, the third party must make sure
the class files are forever available at some codebase. </p>

<p>One potential problem with adding a third-party UI is that in a strict
client-side security policy, downloaded code will by default only have
permission to connect back to the host from which the code was downloaded. In
that case, if the third-party UI's codebase is on a different host than the
service proxy's codebase, the service proxy won't be allowed to talk back to
its host at the behest of the UI. Therefore, for a third-party UI to work in
practice, either the third-party UI's codebase must be on the same host that
serves the service's codebase, or the client must specifically relax its
security policy in order to use the third-party UI. </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<h1>8. Evolution and Prior Knowledge</h1>

<p>In the future, the Service UI API can evolve in several different ways. Any
party can define new role types and their meanings, new attribute classes, and
new factory types. Any party can identify new toolkit types. For clients to be
able to use these new types, the new types will need to be publicized. Before a
client will be able to use a role, factory, or attribute type, that client's
programmers must have had prior knowledge of the type. </p>

<p>Other than service-specific UI roles created under Jini Service APIs, new
roles should come from the Service UI project at the Jini Community. Service
providers should resist temptation to define new role types, as that
complicates clients' jobs. Clients should be able to program to the interface
(particular Jini Service APIs about which they have prior knowledge), rather
than be forced to program to one or more implementations of that interface.
Whether role types are being defined for particular Jini Service APIs, or
globally for the Jini Service UI API, the preferred way to define the role
interfaces is via the Jini Community Process. </p>

<p>As mentioned previously, new UI factory interface types should be defined
with great care. The main justification for a new set of UI factory types is
when new UI toolkits appear on the scene. The preferred way to define these
interfaces is via the Jini Community Process. Similarly, although anyone can
define new attribute types, the preferred way to define these types is through
the Jini Community Process. </p>

<p>The Jini Community is the preferred process to define new role, factory, and
attribute types because it is the best way to avoid a explosion of types. For
example, if a certain attribute type is needed, and twenty different parties
define basically the same attribute, but with twenty slightly different names
and behaviors, and in twenty different packages, then clients wanting to use
that kind of attribute would need to support all twenty variations. It would be
far better if those twenty parties agreed on one attribute class. Enabling such
collaborations is the Jini Community's main purpose. If twenty parties can agree
upon one attribute class, then clients need to be aware of less
information (one attribute class versus twenty), and the resulting client
programs would likely work more reliably. </p>

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>
<H1>9. Consistent Serialized Forms</H1>

<p>
Because the Jini lookup service uses exact matching of the serialized forms of entry fields, it is critical that fields that will be used in template lookups have serialized forms that are consistent across all virtual machines.  However, there is no guarantee that implementations of the <code>Set</code> interface, the declared type of the <code>attributes</code> field of <code>UIDescriptor</code>, have consistent serialized forms across all virtual machines.  For example, <code>java.util.HashSet</code>, perhaps the most commonly used implementation of <code>Set</code>, does not guarantee a consistent serialized form.  As a result, if a <code>UIDescriptor</code> that contains a <code>HashSet</code> in its <code>attributes</code> field is retrieved from a Jini lookup service, the serialized a form of the <code>attributes</code> field could be different if the <code>UIDescriptor</code> is reserialized as part of a template.  This means that a <code>UIDescriptor</code>, when retrieved from a Jini lookup service and used immediately in a lookup template, may not match itself.

<p>
The Service UI API was defined under the assumption that
<code>UIDescriptor</code>s in
Jini lookup templates might contain non-<code>null</code>
<code>role</code> and <code>toolkit</code> fields, but
would always contain <code>null</code> in their
<code>attributes</code> and <code>factory</code> fields.
It was expected that attributes could be inspected on the client side to
select between multiple matches of a Jini lookup. Once a
<code>UIDescriptor</code> was selected, it was expected that clients would use
the <code>factory</code> field to produce the selected UI. Because of
these assumptions, the <code>UIDescriptor</code> class was not designed to
ensure a template in which all four fields were non-<code>null</code>
would work.  In other words, the designers were aware that the 
<code>attributes</code> field could not be used in lookup templates, 
but did not imagine that anyone would ever need to do that.

<p>
When used in templates intended for basic lookup of Jini services,
<code>UIDescriptor</code>s will likely never have non-<code>null</code> 
<code>attributes</code> fields. Nevertheless, <code>UIDescriptor</code>s
used in templates intended to modify the attribute sets of
already-registered Jini services could very likely contain
non-<code>null</code> <code>attributes</code> fields. For example,
to add an object to the attributes set of a
<code>UIDescriptor</code> already registered as part
particular Jini service item, you must pass a template <code>UIDescriptor</code>
that exactly matches the registered <code>UIDescriptor</code> in
the <code>attrSetTemplates</code> parameter of either:

<ul>
<li><code>modifyAttributes</code> method of <code>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceRegistration</code>
<li><code>modifyLookupAttributes</code> method of <code>net.jini.admin.ServiceRegistration</code>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, the use case of modifying a <code>UIDescriptor</code> in
an already-registered Jini service item was never considered during the initial
design discussions leading to 1.0 release of the Service UI API. To
address this need, the 1.1 version of this specification narrows slightly
the contracts of these methods and constructors:

<ul>
<li><code>UIDescriptor(java.lang.String role,
    java.lang.String toolkit, java.util.Set attributes,
    java.rmi.MarshalledObject factory)</code> constructor of
    <code>net.jini.lookup.entry.UIDescriptor</code>
<li><code>Locales(java.util.Set locales)</code> constructor of
    <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute.Locales</code>
<li><code>RequiredPackages(java.util.Map packages)</code> constructor of
    <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute.RequiredPackages</code>
<li><code>UIFactoryTypes(java.util.Set typeNames)</code> constructor of
    <code>net.jini.lookup.ui.attribute.UIFactoryTypes</code>
</ul>

<p>
The 1.1 specification adds to the contracts of each of these constructors
a requirement that they copy the contents of the passed <code>Set</code>
or <code>Map</code> into a serializable read-only version that has a consistent serialized
form across all VMs. This new requirement yields the desired behavior when
attempting to modify <code>UIDescriptor</code>s already part of service items registered in lookup
services.

<P><B>splitwebpage</B>

<H1>10. Package <CODE>net.jini.lookup.entry</CODE></H1>

<P>
The Service UI API defines two classes, <code>UIDescriptor</code> and <code>UIDescriptorBean</code>,
that were placed in a pre-existing package,
<code>net.jini.lookup.entry</code>.
This specification does not provide a complete specification of
the <code>net.jini.lookup.entry</code> package. It does, however,
provide a complete specification of classes
<code>net.jini.lookup.entry.UIDescriptor</code> and
<code>net.jini.lookup.entry.UIDescriptorBean</code>.

</DL>
<H3>10.1.3. Field <CODE>role</CODE></H3>
<P>
<CODE>
public <STRONG>role</STRONG><BR>
</CODE>
<P>
Gives the fully qualified name of the interface that represents
 the role of the UI generated by the marshalled UI factory.
 If the client program unmarshals the UI factory and invokes a factory method, the
 UI returned by the factory method must implement the role the interface specified by
 <CODE>role</CODE>.

 <P>
 For a client program to be able to use a UI, the client has to have prior knowledge
 of the UI semantics, which is defined by the UI's role type. Thus, for a client
 to be able to use a UI, the client must understand the semantics
 of the type whose fully qualified name is given in the <CODE>String</CODE>
 referenced from the <CODE>role</CODE> field of that UI's <CODE>UIDescriptor</CODE>.

 <P>
 For example, two role types that are defined in the <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui</CODE>
 package by the Jini Service UI Specification are <CODE>MainUI</CODE>, for a main UI
 to a Jini service, and <CODE>AdminUI</CODE>, for an administration UI. Other role types
 may be defined by the Jini Service UI Specification and by individual Jini service API
 specifications.

 <P>
 As the strings referenced from the <CODE>role</CODE> field are Java type names, they
 are intended to be manipulated by client programs only. They should not be shown to a user.
<H3>10.1.4. Field <CODE>toolkit</CODE></H3>
<P>
<CODE>
public <STRONG>toolkit</STRONG><BR>
</CODE>
<P>
A <code>String</code> to facilitate searching whose value represents the main UI toolkit (for example
 Swing or AWT) which the produced UI makes use of. The value to which this field should
 be set is defined by the semantics of the factory type. (This field is intended
 to facilitate searches. For example, a client can search for all blender services that have Swing
 MainUI's.)
<H3>10.1.5. Field <CODE>attributes</CODE></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>get()</CODE> method of this <CODE>MarshalledObject</CODE>
 must return an object that implements one or more UI factory interfaces. The actual

 the class loader with which the service proxy object referenced

<H4>10.1.8.1. Serialized Field <CODE>role</CODE></H4>
<P>
<CODE>
java.lang.String <STRONG>role</STRONG><BR>
</CODE>
<P>
Gives the fully qualified name of the interface that represents
 the role of the UI generated by the marshalled UI factory.
 If the client program unmarshals the UI factory and invokes a factory method, the
 UI returned by the factory method must implement the role the interface specified by
 <CODE>role</CODE>.

 <P>
 For a client program to be able to use a UI, the client has to have prior knowledge
 of the UI semantics, which is defined by the UI's role type. Thus, for a client
 to be able to use a UI, the client must understand the semantics
 of the type whose fully qualified name is given in the <CODE>String</CODE>
 referenced from the <CODE>role</CODE> field of that UI's <CODE>UIDescriptor</CODE>.

 <P>
 For example, two role types that are defined in the <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui</CODE>
 package by the Jini Service UI Specification are <CODE>MainUI</CODE>, for a main UI
 to a Jini service, and <CODE>AdminUI</CODE>, for an administration UI. Other role types
 may be defined by the Jini Service UI Specification and by individual Jini service API
 specifications.

 <P>
 As the strings referenced from the <CODE>role</CODE> field are Java type names, they
 are intended to be manipulated by client programs only. They should not be shown to a user.

 Swing or AWT) which the produced UI makes use of. The value to which this field should
 be set is defined by the semantics of the factory type. (This field is intended
 to facilitate searches. For example, a client can search for all blender services that have Swing
 MainUI's.)

<H2>11.5. Interface <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI</CODE></H2>
<P><CODE>public interface AboutUI<BR>
</CODE>
<P>
UI role interface implemented by About UIs, which enable users to
 view (or in some way experience) information about a service.
 If a UI descriptor's UI factory produces a UI that implements
 this interface (i.e., produces a About UI), the UI descriptor's
 <CODE>role</CODE> field must reference a <CODE>String</CODE> with the value
 <CODE>"net.jini.lookup.ui.AboutUI"</CODE>.

 <P>
 The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is an
 object called the "role object."
 Any factory method that produces an About UI must accept as the role object the
 service item (the <CODE>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</CODE>) of the service
 with which the About UI is associated.

 <P>
 About UIs should allow clients to configure them before they
 begin. For example, About UIs produced by <CODE>FrameFactory</CODE>,
 <CODE>JFrameFactory</CODE>, <CODE>WindowFactory</CODE>
 and <CODE>JWindowFactory</CODE> (all members of the <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui.factory</CODE> package)
 should not be visible when they are returned from the factory method. This allows clients to set
 the UI's position and size, for example, before making the UI
 visible by invoking <CODE>setVisible(true)</CODE> on the UI.

 <P>
 A client should be
 able to invoke a About UI factory method multiple times sequentially. In other words, if a user
 uses a service via a About UI, then says exit, then double clicks once again on the service icon,
 the client can just simply invoke a UI factory method again, and get another About UI for the same
 service. About UIs, therefore, should be written so that they work no matter what state
 the service object happens to be in when the About UI is created.

 <P>
 It is recommended that clients use multiple About UIs for the same service only sequentially, and
 avoid creating multiple About UIs for the same service that operate concurrently with one another.
 But because some clients may create and use multiple About UIs at the same time for the same service,
 providers of services and About UIs should program defensively, to ensure that multiple About UIs
 for the same service at the same time will all work together concurrently.
<H3>11.5.1. Field <CODE>ROLE</CODE></H3>
<P>
<CODE>
public static final <STRONG>ROLE</STRONG><BR>
</CODE>
<P>
Convenience constant to use in the <CODE>role</CODE>

<H2>11.6. Interface <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI</CODE></H2>
<P><CODE>public interface AdminUI<BR>
</CODE>
<P>
UI role interface implemented by Admin UIs,
 which enable users to administer a service.
 If a UI descriptor's UI factory produces a UI that implements
 this interface (i.e., produces a Admin UI), the UI descriptor's
 <CODE>role</CODE> field must reference a <CODE>String</CODE> with the value
 <CODE>"net.jini.lookup.ui.AdminUI"</CODE>.

 <P>
 The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is an
 object called the "role object."
 Any factory method that produces an Admin UI must accept as the role object the
 service item (the <CODE>net.jini.core.lookup.ServiceItem</CODE>) of the service
 with which the Admin UI is associated.

 <P>
 Admin UIs should allow clients to configure them before they

<H2>11.7. Interface <CODE>net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI</CODE></H2>
<P><CODE>public interface MainUI<BR>
</CODE>
<P>
UI role interface implemented by Main UIs,
 which enable client programs to grant users general access to a service.
 If a UI descriptor's UI factory produces a UI that implements
 this interface (i.e., produces a Main UI), the UI descriptor's
 <CODE>role</CODE> field must reference a <CODE>String</CODE> with the value
 <CODE>"net.jini.lookup.ui.MainUI"</CODE>.

 <P>
 The first parameter of any factory method declared in a UI factory type is an

 with which the Main UI is associated.

 <P>

</CODE>
<P>
UI attribute that enables clients to get a list of
 the fully qualified names and version numbers of packages
 required by a UI.

 <P>
 One or more <CODE>RequiredPackages</CODE> attributes may appear
 in the attributes of a <CODE>UIDescriptor</CODE>. Client programs
 interested in a UI may wish to verify that they have all required
 packages mentioned in the <CODE>RequiredPackages</CODE> attributes
 (if any) contained in the UI's <CODE>UIDescriptor</CODE>, before
 they attempt to create the UI. If the client is lacking any required
 packages (either because the entire package is absent or because the
 package is present but of an incompatible version), the client will
 not be able to use the UI,

 <P>
 The intent of this attribute is to provide a quick way for a client program
 to determine that a UI is unusable by a client, not to grant a guarantee that a UI
 is definitely usable by the client. If a client is missing a required package,
 or has an incompatible version of a required package, the client cannot use the UI.
 But if the client has compatible versions of all required packages listed in a
 <CODE>RequiredPackage</CODE> attribute, the client may or may not be able to
 use the UI.

 <P>
 UI providers should take bold and valiant strides to list in a <CODE>RequiredPackage</CODE>
 attribute all known packages required of the client, so that if
 the client discovers it has compatible versions of all listed packages and
 attempts to generate the UI via the factory method, the client will likely
 succeed. However, client programmers should bear in mind that a
 <CODE>RequiredPackage</CODE> attribute doesn't necessarily list
 <EM>all</EM> required packages. As a result, satisfying all required packages
 doesn't absolutely guarantee the UI will work on the client.
 As a result, client programs should program defensively.
 (For example, clients should probably catch <CODE>LinkageError</CODE>
 in appropriate places when dealing with UIs, even if they find they have
 compatible versions of all required packages listed in <CODE>RequiredPackage</CODE>
 attributes.)

 The version numbers must take the form of "specification version numbers," as used
 by the <CODE>java.lang.Package</CODE> class:

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Specification version numbers use a "Dewey Decimal" syntax that consists of positive
 decimal integers separated by periods ".", for example, "2.0" or "1.2.3.4.5.6.7". This
 allows an extensible number to be used to represent major, minor, micro, etc versions.
 The version number must begin with a number.

<P>
Constructs a <CODE>UIFactoryTypes</CODE> attribute using the
 passed <CODE>Set</CODE>. The <CODE>Set</CODE> can
 be mutable or immutable, and must contain only
 <CODE>String</CODE>s. Each <CODE>String</CODE> should
 represent a fully qualified Java type name of a UI factory
 interface. This constructor copies
 the contents of the passed <code>Set</code> into a

 <P>
 The <code>isAssignableTo</code> method of this class will only
 return <code>true</code> for types whose names are passed
 explicitly to this constructor via the <CODE>typeNames</CODE> parameter.
 This constructor does not inspect the inheritance hierarchies of the

 type passed in parameter <CODE>classObj</CODE>.
 Else, returns <CODE>false</CODE>.

 <P>
 This method compares the fully qualified name
 of the type represented by the passed <CODE>Class</CODE> with
 the fully qualified names of UI factory interfaces implemented
 by the UI factory's class. If
 an exact string match is found, this method returns <CODE>true</CODE>.
 If the UI factory is ultimately loaded with a class loader whose
 parent-delegation chain doesn't include the class loader
 that defined the passed class, a type with the same name
 would be loaded into a different namespace of
 the virtual machine. If so, the two types would
 be considered different by the virtual machine, even though
 they shared the same fully qualified name.
