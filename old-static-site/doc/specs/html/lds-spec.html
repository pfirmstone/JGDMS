<h3 class="Heading2">
  <a name="1000045"> </a>LD.1	 Introduction
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000634"> </a>Part of the <a href="discovery-spec.html"><em>Jini<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Discovery and Join Specification</em></a> is devoted to defining the discovery requirements for well-behaved Jini clients and services, called <em class="Emphasis">discovering entities</em>, which are required to participate in the multicast discovery protocols. Discovering entities are required to send multicast discovery requests to lookup services with which the entities wish to interact. In addition, they must continuously listen for and act on announcements from the desired lookup services. Interactions with a discovered lookup service may involve registration with that lookup service, or may simply involve querying the lookup service for services of interest (or both). To find <em class="Emphasis">specific</em> lookup services, discovering entities also need to be able to participate in the unicast discovery protocol.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1002945"> </a>Under certain circumstances, a discovering entity may find it useful to allow a third party to perform the entity's discovery duties. For example, an activatable entity that wishes to deactivate may wish to employ a special Jini technology-enabled service (<em class="Emphasis">Jini service</em>)--referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">lookup discovery service</em>--to perform discovery duties on its behalf. Such an entity may wish to deactivate for various reasons, one being to conserve computational resources. While the entity is inactive, the lookup discovery service, running on the same or a separate host, would employ the discovery protocols to find lookup services in which the entity has expressed interest and would notify the entity when a previously unavailable lookup service has become available.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003079"> </a>The facilities of the lookup discovery service are of particular value in a scenario in which a new lookup service is added to a long-lived djinn containing multiple inactive services. Without the use of a lookup discovery service, the time frame over which the new lookup service is fully populated can be both unpredictable and unbounded.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1015449"> </a>To understand why this time frame can be unpredictable, consider the fact that an inactive service has no way of discovering a new lookup service. This means that each inactive service in the djinn that wishes to discover and join a new lookup service must first activate. Since activation of a service occurs when some client attempts to use the service, the amount of time that passes between the arrival of the new lookup service and the activation of the service can vary greatly over the range of services in the djinn. Thus, the time frame over which the lookup service becomes fully populated cannot be predicted because it could take arbitrarily long before all of the services activate and then discover and join the new lookup service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003114"> </a>In addition to being unpredictable, the time it takes for the lookup service to fully populate can also be unbounded. This is because there is no guarantee that the lookup service will send multicast announcements between the time the service activates and the time it deactivates. If the timing is right, it is possible that one or more of the services in the djinn may never discover and join the new lookup service. Thus, without the use of the lookup discovery service, the new lookup service may never fully populate.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1002949"> </a>As another example of a discovering entity that may find it useful to allow a third party to perform the entity's discovery duties, consider an entity that exists in an environment with one of the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1002999"> </a>The environment does not support multicast.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1003000"> </a>The environment contains no lookup services within the entity's <em class="Emphasis">multicast radius</em> (roughly, the number of hops beyond which neither the multicast requests from the entity nor the multicast announcements from the lookup service will propagate).<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1003001"> </a>The environment does contain lookup service(s) within the entity's multicast radius, but at least one service needed by the entity is not registered with any lookup service within that radius.
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003002"> </a>If such an entity was provided with references to lookup services--located outside of the entity's multicast radius--that contain services needed by the entity, the entity could contact each lookup service and retrieve the desired service references. One way to provide the entity with access to those lookup services might be to configure the entity to find and use a lookup discovery service, operating beyond the entity's range, that can employ multicast discovery to find nearby lookup services belonging to groups in which the entity has expressed interest. After acquiring references to the targeted lookup services, the lookup discovery service would pass those references to the entity, providing the entity with access to the services registered with each lookup service. In this way, the entity participates in the multicast discovery protocols through a proxy relationship with the lookup discovery service, gaining access not only to lookup services outside of its own range, but also to all of the services registered with those lookup services.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003028"> </a>Note that the scenario just described does not come without restrictions. For the lookup discovery service to be able to "link" an entity with lookup services in the way just described, the lookup discovery service must be registered with a lookup service having a location that either is known to the entity or is within the multicast radius of the entity. Furthermore, the lookup discovery service must be running on a host that is located within the multicast radius of the lookup services with which the entity wishes to be linked. That is, the entity must be able to find the lookup discovery service, and the lookup discovery service must be able to find the other desired lookup services.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000724"> </a>To address these scenarios, the lookup discovery service participates in both the multicast discovery protocols and the unicast discovery protocol on behalf of a registered discovering entity or <em class="Emphasis">client</em>. This service will listen for and process multicast announcement packets from Jini lookup services and will, until successful, repeatedly attempt to discover specific lookup services that the client is interested in finding.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000786"> </a>Upon discovery of a previously undiscovered lookup service of interest, the lookup discovery service notifies all entities that have requested the discovery of that lookup service that such an event has occurred. The event mechanism employed by the lookup discovery service satisfies the requirements defined in the <a href="event-spec.html"><em class="Emphasis">Jini Distributed Events Specification</em></a>. Note that the entity that receives such an event notification does not have to be the client of the lookup discovery service; it may be a third-party event-handling service such as an event mailbox service. Once a client is notified of the discovery of a lookup service, it is left to the client to define the semantics of how it interacts with that lookup service. For example, the client may wish to join the lookup service, simply query it for other useful services, or both.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000236"> </a>The lookup discovery service must be implemented as a well-behaved Jini service and must comply with all of the policies embodied in the Jini technology programming model. Thus, the resources granted by this service are leased, and implementations of this service must adhere to the distributed leasing model for Jini technology as defined in the <a href="lease-spec.html"><em class="Emphasis">Jini Distributed Leasing Specification</em></a>. That is, the lookup discovery service will grant its services for only a limited period of time without an active expression of continuing interest on the part of the client.

  <a name="1000124"> </a>LD.2	 The Interface
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000801"> </a>The <code>LookupDiscoveryService</code> interface defines the service--referred to as the <em class="Emphasis">lookup discovery service</em>--previously introduced in this specification. Through this interface, other Jini services and clients may request that discovery processing be performed on their behalf. This interface belongs to the <code>net.jini.discovery</code> package, and any service implementing this interface must comply with the definition of a Jini service. This interface is not a remote interface; each implementation of this service exports a front end proxy object that implements this interface local to the client, using an implementation-specific protocol to communicate with the actual remote server (the back end). All of the proxy methods must obey normal Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) remote interface semantics except where explicitly noted. Two proxy objects are equal (using the <code>equals</code> method) if they are proxies for the same lookup discovery service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005712"> </a>The one method defined in this interface throws a <code>RemoteException</code><code>, </code>and requires only the default serialization semantics so that this interface can be implemented directly using Java RMI.

}
</pre>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003168"> </a>When requesting a registration with the lookup discovery service, the client indicates the lookup services it is interested in discovering by submitting two sets of objects. Each set may contain zero or more elements. One set consists of the names of the groups whose members are lookup services the client wishes to be discovered. The other set consists of <code>LookupLocator</code> objects, each corresponding to a specific lookup service the client wishes to be discovered.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003183"> </a>For each successful registration the lookup discovery service will manage both the set of group names and the set of locators submitted. These sets will be referred to as the <em class="Emphasis">managed set of groups</em> and the <em class="Emphasis">managed set of locators</em>, respectively. The managed set of groups associated with a particular registration contains the names of the groups whose members consist of lookup services that the client wishes to be discovered through <em class="Emphasis">multicast</em> <em class="Emphasis">discovery</em>. Similarly, the managed set of locators contains instances of <code>LookupLocator</code>, each corresponding to a specific lookup service that the client wishes to be discovered through <em class="Emphasis">unicast</em> <em class="Emphasis">discovery</em>. The references to the lookup services that have been discovered will be maintained in a set referred to as the <em class="Emphasis">managed set of lookup services</em> (or managed set of <em class="Emphasis">registrars</em>).
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1015969"> </a>Note that when the general term <em class="Emphasis">managed set</em> is used, it should be clear from the context whether groups, locators, or registrars are being discussed. Furthermore, when the term <em class="Emphasis">group discovery</em> or <em class="Emphasis">locator discovery</em> is used, it should be taken to mean, respectively, the employment of either the multicast discovery protocols or the unicast discovery protocol to discover lookup services that correspond to members of the appropriate managed set.
<p>
Finally, with respect to any remote operation, two classes of exception are referenced in this document. The term <em>indefinite exception</em> refers to a class of exception where any such exception does not allow assertions to be made about the probability of success (or failure) of future attempts to perform the operation. A <code>RemoteException</code> caused by a transient communication failure is one such example of an exception that can be classified as an indefinite exception. As such, whenever an indefinite exception is encountered, retrying the operation at a later time may be advisable because the operation may succeed when retried.
<p>
The other class of exception to note is identified by the term <em>definite exception</em>, which refers to a class of exception where any such exception is indicative of a permanent failure. That is, when an operation fails as a result of an exception that can be classified as a definite exception, that exception allows one to assert that any future attempts to perform the failed operation will also be met with failure. In many cases, a <code>SecurityException</code> can be interpreted as a definite exception. Thus, whenever an operation fails as a result of a definite exception, because it is a virtual certainty that failure will again result on all future attempts to perform the operation, it is generally not advisable to retry the operation.

  <a name="1000820"> </a>LD.3	 The Semantics
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005549"> </a>To employ the lookup discovery service to perform discovery on its behalf, a client must first register with the lookup discovery service by invoking the <code>register</code> method defined in the <code>LookupDiscoveryService</code> interface. The <code>register</code> method is the only method specified by this interface.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="1013657"> </a>LD.3.1	 Registration Semantics
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003200"> </a>An invocation of the <code>register</code> method produces an object--referred to as a <code>registration object</code> (or simply a <code>registration</code>)--that is mutable. That is, the registration object contains methods through which it may be changed. Because registrations are mutable, each invocation of the <code>register</code> method produces a new registration object. Thus, the <code>register</code> method is not idempotent.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005715"> </a>The <code>register</code> method may throw a <code>RemoteException</code>. Typically, this exception occurs when there is a communication failure between the client and the lookup discovery service. When this exception does occur, the registration may or may not have been successful.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005542"> </a>Each registration with the lookup discovery service is persistent across restarts (or crashes) of the lookup discovery service until the lease on the registration expires or is cancelled.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1000950"> </a>The <code>register</code> method takes the following as arguments: 
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1015982"> </a>A <code>String</code> array, none of whose elements may be <code>null</code>, consisting of zero or more elements in which each element is the name of a group whose members are lookup services that the client requesting the registration wishes to be discovered via group discovery<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1015983"> </a>An array of <code>LookupLocator</code> objects, none of whose elements may be <code>null</code>, consisting of zero or more elements in which each element corresponds to a specific lookup service that the client requesting the registration wishes to be discovered via locator discovery<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1000887"> </a>A non-<code>null</code> <code>RemoteEventListener</code> object which specifies the entity that will receive events notifying the registration when a lookup service of interest is discovered or discarded<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1004704"> </a>Either <code>null</code> or an instance of <code>MarshalledObject</code> specifying an object that will be included in the notification event that the lookup discovery service sends to the registered listener<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1004705"> </a>A <code>long</code> value representing the amount of time (in milliseconds) for which the resources of the lookup discovery service are being requested
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1001052"> </a>The <code>register</code> method returns an object that implements the <code>LookupDiscoveryRegistration</code> interface. It is through this returned object that the client interacts with the lookup discovery service. This interaction includes activities such as group and locator management, state retrieval, and discarding discovered but unavailable lookup services so that they are eligible for rediscovery (see <a href="lds-spec.html#1000482">Section&nbsp;LD.4.1, "The LookupDiscoveryRegistration Interface"</a> for definition of the semantics of the methods of the <code>LookupDiscoveryRegistration</code> interface).
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016362"> </a>The <code>groups</code> argument takes a <code>String</code> array, none of whose elements may be <code>null</code>. Although it is acceptable to specify <code>null</code> (which is equivalent to <code>DiscoveryGroupManagement.ALL_GROUPS</code>) for the <code>groups</code> argument itself, if the argument contains one or more <code>null</code> elements, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown. If the value is <code>null</code>, the lookup discovery service will attempt to discover all lookup services located within the multicast radius of the host on which the lookup discovery service is running. If an empty array (equivalent to <code>DiscoveryGroupManagement.NO_GROUPS</code>) is passed in, then no group discovery will be performed for the associated registration until the client, through the registration's <code>setGroups</code> or <code>addGroups</code> method, changes the contents of the managed set of groups to either a non-empty set of group names or <code>null</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1006025"> </a>The <code>locators</code> argument takes an array of <code>LookupLocator</code> objects, none of whose elements may be <code>null</code>. If either the empty array or <code>null</code> is passed in as the <code>locators</code> argument, then no locator discovery will be performed for the associated registration until the client, through the registration's <code>addLocators</code> or <code>setLocators</code> method, changes the managed set of locators to a non-empty set of locators. Although it is acceptable to input <code>null</code> for the <code>locators</code> argument itself, if the argument contains one or more null elements, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1013740"> </a>If the <code>register</code> method is invoked with a set of group names and a set of locators in which either or both sets contain duplicate elements (where duplicate locators are determined by <code>LookupLocator.equals</code>), the invocation is equivalent to constructing this class with no duplicates in either set.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005261"> </a>Upon discovery of a lookup service, through either group discovery or locator discovery, the lookup discovery service will send an event, referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">discovered event</em>, to the listener associated with the registration produced by the call to <code>register</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005265"> </a>After initial discovery of a lookup service, the lookup discovery service will continue to monitor the group membership state reflected in the multicast announcements from that lookup service. Depending on the lookup service's current group membership, the lookup discovery service may send either a discovered event or an event referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">discarded event</em>. The conditions under which either a discovered event or a discarded event will be sent are as follows:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1005275"> </a>If the multicast announcements from an already discovered lookup service indicate that the lookup service is a member of a new group, a discovered event will be sent to the listener of each registration that has yet to receive a discovered event for that lookup service, but that has previously registered interest in the new group.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1005291"> </a>If the multicast announcements from an already discovered lookup service indicate that the lookup service has changed its group membership in such a way that the lookup service is no longer of interest to one or more of the registrations that previously registered interest in the groups of that lookup service, a discarded event will be sent to the listener of each such registration. This type of discarded event is sometimes referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">passive no-interest discarded event</em> ("passive" because the lookup discovery service, rather than the client, initiated the discard process).<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="1005282"> </a>If the multicast announcements from an already discovered lookup service are no longer being received, a discarded event will be sent to the listener of each registration that previously registered interest in one or more of that lookup service's member groups. This type of discarded event is sometimes referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">passive communication discarded event</em>.
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1004757"> </a>It is important to note that when the lookup discovery service (passively) discards a lookup service, due to group membership changes (lost interest) or unavailability (communication failure), the discarded event will be sent to only the listeners of those registrations that have previously requested that the affected lookup service be discovered through at least group discovery. That is, the listener of any registration that is interested in the affected lookup service through <em class="Emphasis">only</em> locator discovery will not be sent either type of passive discarded event. This is because the semantics of the lookup discovery service assume that since the client, through the registration request, expressed no interest in discovering the lookup service through its group membership, the client must also have no interest in any group-related changes in that lookup service's state.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016018"> </a>A more detailed discussion of the event semantics of the lookup discovery service is presented in <a href="lds-spec.html#1003321">Section&nbsp;LD.3.2, "Event Semantics"</a>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1002730"> </a>A valid parameter must be passed as the <code>listener</code> argument of the <code>register</code> method. If a <code>null</code> value is input to this argument, then a <code>NullPointerException</code> will be thrown and the registration fails.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1015038"> </a>Note that if an indefinite exception occurs while attempting to send a discovered or discarded event to a registration's listener, the lookup discovery service will continue to attempt to send the event until either the event is successfully delivered or the client's lease on that registration expires. If an <code>UnknownEventException</code> or a definite exception occurs while attempting to send a discovered or discarded event to a registration's listener, the lookup discovery service assumes that the client is in an unknown, possibly corrupt state, and will cancel the lease on the registration and clear the registration from its managed set.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1003258"> </a>The state information maintained by the lookup discovery service includes the set of group names, locators, and listeners submitted by each client through each invocation of the <code>register</code> method, with duplicates eliminated. This state information contains no knowledge of the clients that register with the lookup discovery service. Thus, there is no requirement that a client identify itself during the registration process.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="1003321"> </a>LD.3.2	 Event Semantics
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1004776"> </a>For each registration created by the lookup discovery service, an event identifier will be generated that uniquely maps the registration to the listener as well as to the registration's managed set of groups and managed set of locators. This event identifier is returned as a part of the returned registration object and is unique across all other active registrations with the lookup discovery service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1006046"> </a>Whenever the lookup discovery service finds a lookup service matching the discovery criteria of one or more of its registrations, it sends an instance of <code>RemoteDiscoveryEvent</code> (a subclass of <code>RemoteEvent</code>) to the listener corresponding to each such registration. The event sent to each listener will contain the appropriate event identifier.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016278"> </a>Once an event signaling the discovery (by group or locator) of a desired lookup service has been sent, no other discovered events for that lookup service will be sent to a registration's listener until the lookup service is discarded (either actively, by the client through the registration, or passively by the lookup discovery service) and then rediscovered. Note that more information about what it means for a lookup service to be discarded is presented in <a href="lds-spec.html#1013657">Section&nbsp;LD.3.1, "Registration Semantics"</a> and the section of this specification titled "<a href="lds-spec.html#1004325">Discarding Lookup Services</a>".
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016285"> </a>If, between the time a lookup service is discarded and the time it is rediscovered, a new registration is requested having parameters indicating interest in that lookup service, upon rediscovery of the lookup service an event will also be sent to that new registration's listener.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016032"> </a>The sequence numbers for a given event identifier are strictly increasing (as defined in the <a href="event-spec.html"><em class="Emphasis">Jini Distributed Events Specification</em></a>), which means that when any two such successive events have sequence numbers that differ by only a value of 1, then no events have been missed. On the other hand, when the set of received events is viewed in order, if the difference between the sequence numbers of two successive events is greater than 1, then one or more events may or may not have been missed. For example, a difference greater than 1 could occur if the lookup discovery service crashes, even if no events are lost because of the crash. When two such successive events have sequence numbers whose difference is greater than 1, there is said to be a <em class="Emphasis">gap</em> between the events.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1005149"> </a>When a gap occurs between events, the local state (on the client) related to the discovered lookup services may or may not fall out of sync with the corresponding remote state maintained by the lookup discovery service. For example, if the gap corresponds to a missed event representing the (initial) discovery of a targeted lookup service, the remote state will reflect this discovery, whereas the client's local state will not. To allow clients to identify and correct such a situation, each registration object provides a method that returns a set consisting of the proxies to the lookup services that have been discovered for that registration. With this information the client can update its local state.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1006050"> </a>When requesting a registration with the lookup discovery service, a client may also supply (as a parameter to the <code>register</code> method) a reference to an object, wrapped in a <code>MarshalledObject</code>, referred to as a <em class="Emphasis">handback</em>.

  <a name="1014210"> </a>For each of these cases, whenever the lookup discovery service discards a lookup service, it will send an event to the registration's listener to notify it that the lookup service has been discarded.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1004599"> </a>The <code>discard</code> method provides a mechanism for registered clients to inform the lookup discovery service of the existence of an unavailable--or <em class="Emphasis">unreachable</em>--lookup service, and to request that the lookup discovery service discard that lookup service and make it eligible for rediscovery.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1002366"> </a>The <code>discard</code> method takes a single argument: the proxy to the lookup service to discard.

Whether or not the lookup discovery service discards such an unreachable lookup service is dependent on how each registration is configured for discovery with respect to that lookup service. If every registration that is configured to discover the unreachable lookup service is configured to discover it through locator discovery only, the lookup discovery service will not discard the lookup service. In other words, in order for the lookup discovery service to discard a lookup service it has determined is unreachable, at least one registration must be configured for discovery of at least one group in which that lookup service is a member.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1014334"> </a>Thus, whenever a client determines that a previously discovered lookup service has become unreachable, it should not rely on the lookup discovery service to discard the lookup service. Instead, the client should inform the lookup discovery service--through the invocation of the registration's <code>discard</code> method--that the previously discovered lookup service is no longer available and that attempts should be made to rediscover that lookup service for the registration. Typically, a client determines that a lookup service is unavailable when the client attempts to use the lookup service but receives an exception (indefinite or definite) as a result of the attempt.

For all other invocations made prior to rediscovery, the registrations through which the invocation is made are sent a discarded event, and added to the list of registrations that will be notified when rediscovery of the lookup service does occur.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1009331"> </a>The <code>isDiscarded</code> method returns a <code>boolean</code> that indicates whether the event is a discovered event or a discarded event. If the event is a discovered event, then this method returns <code>false</code>. If the event is a discarded event, <code>true</code> is returned.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016149"> </a>The <code>getRegistrars</code> method returns an array consisting of instances of the <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> interface. Each element in the returned set is a proxy to one of the newly discovered or discarded lookup services that caused a <code>RemoteDiscoveryEvent</code> to be sent. Additionally, each element in the returned set will be unique with respect to all other elements in the set, as determined by the equals method provided by each element. This method does not make a remote call. With respect to multiple invocations of this method, each invocation will return a new array.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1009722"> </a>When the lookup discovery service sends an instance of <code>RemoteDiscoveryEvent</code> to the listener of a client's registration, the set of lookup service proxies contained in the event consists of marshalled instances of the <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> interface. The lookup discovery service individually marshals each proxy associated with the event because if it were not to do so, <em class="Emphasis">any</em> deserialization failure on the set would result in an <code>IOException</code>, and failure would be declared for the whole deserialization process, not just an individual element. This would mean that all elements of the set sent in the event--even those that can be successfully deserialized--would be unavailable to the client through this method. Just as with the <code>getRegistrars</code> method defined by the <code>LookupDiscoveryRegistration</code> interface, individually marshalling each element in the set minimizes the "all or nothing" aspect of the deserialization process, allowing the client to recover those proxies that can be successfully unmarshalled and to proceed with processing that might not be possible otherwise.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1009689"> </a>When constructing the return set, this method attempts to unmarshal each element of the set of marshalled proxy objects contained in the event. When failure occurs while attempting to unmarshal any of the elements of that set, this method throws an exception of type <code>LookupUnmarshalException</code>. It is through the contents of this exception that the client can recover any available proxies and perform error handling with respect to the unavailable proxies.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1009759"> </a>If the <code>getRegistrars</code> method returns successfully without throwing a <code>LookupUnmarshalException</code>, the client is guaranteed that all marshalled proxies sent in the event have each been successfully unmarshalled during that particular invocation. Furthermore, after the first such successful invocation, no more unmarshalling attempts will be made (because such attempts are no longer necessary), and all future invocations of this method are guaranteed to return an array with contents identical to the contents of the array returned by the first successful invocation.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1004851"> </a>Note that an array, rather than a single proxy, is returned by the <code>getRegistrars</code> method so that implementations of the lookup discovery service can choose to "batch" the information sent to a registration. With respect to discoveries, batching the information may be particularly useful when a client first registers with the lookup discovery service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1004852"> </a>Upon initial registration, multiple lookup services are typically found over a short period of time, providing the lookup discovery service with the opportunity to send all of the initially discovered lookup services in only one event. Afterward, as so-called "late joiner" lookup services are found sporadically, the lookup discovery service may send events referencing only one lookup service.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1014635"> </a>Note that the event sequence numbers, as defined earlier in <a href="lds-spec.html#1003321">Section&nbsp;LD.3.2, "Event Semantics"</a>, are strictly increasing, even when the information is batched.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1014559"> </a>The <code>getGroups</code> method returns a <code>Map</code> in which the elements of the map's key set are the instances of <code>ServiceID</code> that correspond to each lookup service for which the event was constructed and sent. Each element of the returned map's value set is a <code>String</code> array containing the names of the member groups of the associated lookup service whose <code>ServiceID</code> equals to the corresponding key. This method does not make a remote call. On each invocation of this method, the same <code>Map</code> object is returned; that is, a copy is not made.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1016211"> </a> The <code>Map</code> returned by the <code>getGroups</code> method is keyed by the <code>ServiceID</code> of each lookup service in the event, rather than by the proxy of each lookup service to avoid the deserialization issues addressed by the <code>getRegistrars</code> method. Thus, client's wishing to retrieve the set of member groups corresponding to any element of the array returned by the <code>getRegistrars</code> method, must use the <code>ServiceID</code> of the desired element from that array as the key to the get method of the <code>Map</code> returned by this method and then cast to <code>String</code>[].
