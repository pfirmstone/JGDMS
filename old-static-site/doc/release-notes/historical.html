        take RENEW_RTT time to renew each one, even though when it did
        actually renew them, it batched them.  As N became large, the leases were renewed more and more
        prematurely if N was large enough, RENEW_RTT * N exceeded the remaining
        duration of the lease, and the LRM started continuously renewing the leases
        in a tight loop.</td>

        <td><p>Norm: Client leases are being renewed after the set they are in should
                have expired.</p>
            <p>
                A given client lease should not be renewed after the set it is in
                has expired.  An iron-clad guarantee can't be made here because
                we can't hold onto locks while leases are being renewed.  However,
                the problem with Norm was worse than could be explained by the
                short window between committing to renew a client lease and 
                performing the actual renewal.  The problem arose because
                there was no check in the renewal threads to make sure that
                the set the client lease was in still current, and because the 
                thread that removed sets from the service often runs late.  Such
                a check is now performed so the window where a client lease renewal
                can occur, after the lease on the set the client lease is in has 
                expired, is very small.

                Comment by P. Firmstone Apr 21st 2016: <br>
                These issues would not occur with immutable leases and sets,
                upon renewal a new set with successfully renewed leases
                would be returned.

        <td><p>Norm: Race condition in registering expiration warning event handlers</p>
            <p>The code that generated renewal warning events and expired
            renewal sets had a race condition with the code that processed
            registration of expiration warning events.  This race condition
            could keep Norm from delivery expiration warning events and allow
            client leases to be renewed long after the renewal set they were
            in expired.  Thanks to Ken Olwing for finding this bug and helping
            test the fix.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The specification for Norm is defined not only by the Jini
                Lease Renewal Service Specification, but also by the API 
                documentation (generated by the javadoc tool) for 
                org.apache.river.norm.NormAdmin and net.jini.admin.Administrable.</li>
                <li>
                    If you look at Norm's source code, you will notice a number 
                    of comments that begin with "$$$".  These generally mark
                    places in the code where there is potential for improvement.

        <td><p>ExpirationWarningEvent's get generated late</p>
            <p>
                There seems to be a particular issue with lease expiration warning
                events.  Lease expiration warning events are generated at a
                client-specified minWarning time before the lease on a particular 
                lease-renewal set is about to expire.  It seems that these 
                events often are generated later than they should be, probably
                because of a thread-scheduling issue.  If you register for
                expiration warning events, you may want to choose a minWarning
                time a minute or two longer than what you would choose otherwise
                because of this late notification.

            of readIfExists, read or take locked in the case of readIfExists)

                This bug affected blocking takes that matched entries that
                were read locked by another transaction.  Threads blocked
                by a take should be notified when the release of read lock makes
                new entries eligible for matching.  This manifested itself
                as blocking takes that took longer than expected to return
                after transactions associated with read-locked entries
                were resolved.

            <p>
                Each Outrigger services has a thread that reaps dead entries 
                from its internal data structures.  It has been reported that this 
                thread sometimes dies with a NullPointerException.  The 
                resulting stack trace looks something like this:
            </p>

                At this point, expired and removed entries will no longer be
                reaped and the server will consume increasing amounts of 
                memory until it crashes.  In the case of FrontEndSpace,
                killing the JVM in which the server is currently running and
                letting rmid restart should allow reaping to resume.
