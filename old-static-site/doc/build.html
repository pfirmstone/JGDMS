<title>Building JGDMS</title>
<a name="TOP">
<center><h1>Building JGDMS</h1></center>

<br>
JGDMS includes support for
generating binary (JAR) files and documentation from the provided source code
using the Apache Ant build tool (available from the Ant project site at
Apache.org, <a href="http://ant.apache.org">
               <code>http://ant.apache.org</code></a>). 
<p>
This page describes how to use <code>ant</code> to build the distribution from
the source code. This Ant build process was originally based on Geoff Arnold's
Ant build script, and we thank him for his
contribution.

<p>
It is not necessary to build the JAR files from source code to get started with
Jini technology.  The JAR files are provided for you as part of the starter kit,
depending on your installation options.  The location of the JAR files is 
documented in <a href="info-index.html#examine">info-index.html</a> .  In the
instructions below, <B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B> is the directory into which
you installed the JGDMS distribution.

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Build instructions</h2>

<p>
The following prerequisites must be met before a build can be executed:
<ul>
  <li>	
    The <b><code>bin</code></b> directory of the Java(TM) Platform, Standard
    Edition JDK, v 1.8 (or later) must be in your executable search path. You can
    obtain the Java software at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
    <code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code></a> . 
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Apache Ant, version 1.6.2 or later, must be installed on your system.  You
    can obtain the Ant software from Ant's project site at
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org"><code>http://ant.apache.org</code></a> . 
  </li>
  <p>
</ul>

<p>
The following build options are currently available:
<ul>
  <li>	
    The <b><code>debug</code></b> parameter can be used to override the
    default debuglevel values.  The possible values are "<code>none</code>",
    "<code>lines</code>", "<code>source</code>", and "<code>vars</code>".
    If two or more values are used together, they must be comma-separated
    (eg, "<code>lines,source,vars</code>").  Refer to the javac documentation
    or the javac task section of the Ant documentation for further details
    regarding these debuglevel options.
    <pre>
    ant -Ddebug=lines,source,vars &lt;<i>target</i>&gt;
    </pre
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To build the starter kit JAR files, you must:

<pre>
    cd <B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>

    ant &lt;<i>target</i>&gt;
</pre>

where the basic targets are:
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>
    <b>all.build</b><br>
    This target is also the default target and can be invoked by simply running
    <code>ant</code> without specifying any target.  This target compiles the
    class files for all of the distribution source code, generates Java Remote
    Method Invocation (Java RMI) stub classes, and generates the configentry 
    files.  The class files and configentry files will be placed in the following
    directories, respectively:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/build/classes</code>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/build/configentry</code>
    <br><br>
    Additionally, this target will build all subprojects (currently 'qa' and 'examples/hello').
    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>jars</b><br>
    Creates the JAR files for the distribution, using the compiled class files.
    The compiled class files must already have been created.  The resulting JAR
    files will be placed in the following directories:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/lib</code>    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/lib-dl</code> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/lib-ext</code><br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE</b>:
    <br>
    <i>
    During the jars build, warning messages similar to the following are generated:
    </i>
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>[java] Nested class LogManager$Probe has different preferred state than outer class LogManager</code>
    <br><br>
    <i>
    Messages of this sort are expected and pose no concern to the resulting build.
    </i>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>clean</b><br>
    Removes the class files, configentry files, docs, JAR files, and all associated
    directories generated during the build.

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>doc</b><br>
    Generates all the documentation for the starter kit.
    The documentation will be placed in the following directory:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/doc</code>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>javadoc-api</b><br>
    Generates API documentation for the starter kit, using the Javadoc(TM) tool.
    The documentation will be placed in the following directory:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/doc/api</code>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>javadoc-spec</b><br>
    Generates the specification-only documentation for the starter kit, using the Javadoc(TM) tool.
    The documentation will be placed in the following directory:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/doc/specs/api</code>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>release</b><br>
    This target will compile everything, generate the jar files, generate the javadoc,
    and produce the distribution bundles (binary and source) in the top-level "dist"
    directory.

  </dl>

<h2>Testing your Build</h2>
<p>There are three test harnesses:
<ul>
    <li><b>Unit Tests:</b> The build target is <b>test</b>.  JUnit testing is provided
    because of the popularity of this Unit test framework, reducing the initial
    learning curve for developers, enabling more developers
    to participate.
    </li>
    <li><b>Regression Tests:</b> The build target is <b>jtreg</b> from the build.xml
    file in the qa directory. Jtreg is the Regression Test framework
    for Jini, also utilised by Sun's JRE, you'll need to download jtreg
    separately from <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/">openjdk.java.net/jtreg</a>
    and ensure jtreg is available on your execution path.
    </li>
    <li><b>Integration and Compliance Tests:</b> The build target is <b>qa.run</b> from
    the main build.xml file.
    The Jini QA Test Harness, was developed by Sun, specifically to cater for testing 
    of the Jini Architecture, more information can be found in the qa directory.
    </li>
</ul>
