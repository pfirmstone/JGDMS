  <a name="7127"> </a>TX.1	 Introduction	 
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  Transactions are a fundamental tool for many kinds of computing. A transaction allows a set of operations to be grouped in such a way that they either all succeed or all fail; further, the operations in the set appear from outside the transaction to occur simultaneously. Transactional behaviors are especially important in distributed computing, where they provide a means for enforcing consistency over a set of operations on one or more remote participants. If all the participants are members of a transaction, one response to a remote failure is to abort the transaction, thereby ensuring that no partial results are written.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="34911"> </a>Traditional transaction systems often center around transaction processing monitors that ensure that the correct implementation of transactional semantics is provided by all of the participants in a transaction. Our approach to transactional semantics is somewhat different. Within our system we leave it to the individual objects that take part in a transaction to implement the transactional semantics in the way that is best for that kind of object. What the system primarily provides is the coordination mechanism that those objects can use to communicate the information necessary for the set of objects to agree on the transaction. The goal of this system is to provide the <em class="Emphasis">minimal</em> set of protocols and interfaces that <em class="Emphasis">allow</em> objects to implement transaction semantics rather than the <em class="Emphasis">maximal</em> set of interfaces, protocols, and policies that <em class="Emphasis">ensure</em> the correctness of any possible transaction semantics. So the completion protocol is separate from the semantics of particular transactions.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="34877"> </a>This document presents this completion protocol, which consists of a two-phase commit protocol for distributed transactions. The two-phase commit protocol defines the communication patterns that allow distributed objects and resources to wrap a set of operations in such a way that they appear to be a single operation. The protocol requires a manager that will enable consistent resolution of the operations by a guarantee that all participants will eventually know whether they should commit the operations (roll forward) or abort them (roll backward). A participant can be any object that supports the participant contract by implementing the appropriate interface. Participants are not limited to databases or other persistent storage services.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3222"> </a>Clients and servers will also need to depend on specific transaction semantics. The default transaction semantics for participants is also defined in this document.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="34885"> </a>The two-phase commit protocol presented here, while common in many traditional transaction systems, has the potential to be used in more than just traditional transaction processing applications. Since the semantics of the individual operations and the mechanisms that are used to ensure various properties of the meta-operation joined by the protocol are left up to the individual objects, variations of the usual properties required by transaction processing systems are possible using this protocol, as long as those variances can be resolved by this protocol. A group of objects could use the protocol, for example, as part of a process allowing synchronization of data that have been allowed to drift for efficiency reasons. While this use is not generally considered to be a classical use of transactions, the protocol defined here could be used for this purpose. Some variations will not be possible under these protocols, requiring subinterfaces and subclasses of the ones provided or entirely new interfaces and classes.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="2798"> </a>Because of the possibility of application to situations that are beyond the usual use of transactions, calling the two-phase commit protocol a transaction mechanism is somewhat misleading. However, since the most common use of such a protocol is in a transactional setting, and because we do define a particular set of default transaction semantics, we will follow the usual naming conventions used in such systems rather than attempting to invent a new, parallel vocabulary.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3577"> </a>The classes and interfaces defined by this specification are in the packages <code>net.jini.core.transaction</code> and <code>net.jini.core.transaction.server</code>. In this document you will usually see these types used without a package prefix; as each type is defined, the package it is in is specified.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="33159"> </a>A transaction is created and overseen by a <em class="Emphasis">manager.</em> Each manager implements the interface <code>TransactionManager</code>. Each <em class="Emphasis">transaction</em> is represented by a <code>long</code> identifier that is unique with respect to the transaction's manager.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="34996"> </a>Semantics are represented by <em class="Emphasis">semantic</em> transaction objects, such as the ones that represent the default semantics for services. Even though the manager needs to know only how to complete transactions, clients and participants need to share a common view of the semantics of the transaction. Therefore clients typically create, pass, and operate on semantic objects that contain the transaction identifier instead of using the transaction's identifier directly, and transactable services typically accept parameters of a particular semantic type, such as the <code>Transaction</code> interface used for the default semantics.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35026"> </a>As shown in Figure TX.1.1, a <em class="Emphasis">client</em> asks the manager to create a transaction, typically by using a semantic factory class such as <code>TransactionFactory</code> to create a semantic object. The semantic object created is then passed as a parameter when performing operations on a service. If the service is to accept this transaction and govern its operations thereby, it must <em class="Emphasis">join</em> the transaction as a <em class="Emphasis">participant.</em> Participants in a transaction must implement the <code>TransactionParticipant</code> interface. Particular operations associated with a given transaction are said to be <em class="Emphasis">performed under</em> that transaction. The client that created the transaction might or might not be a participant in the transaction.

  <a name="33449"> </a>TX.1.2	 Distributed Transactions and ACID Properties
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="2733"> </a>The two-phase commit protocol is designed to enable objects to provide <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties. The default transaction semantics define one way to preserve these properties. The <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="2734"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Atomicity:</em> All the operations grouped under a transaction occur or none of them do. The protocol allows participants to discover which of these alternatives is expected by the other participants in the protocol. However, it is up to the individual object to determine whether it wishes to operate in concert with the other participants.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="35529"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Consistency:</em> The completion of a transaction must leave the system in a consistent state. Consistency includes issues known only to humans, such as that an employee should always have a manager. The enforcement of consistency is outside of the realm of the transaction itself--a transaction is a tool to allow consistency guarantees and not itself a guarantor of consistency.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="2736"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Isolation:</em> Ongoing transactions should not affect each other. Participants in a transaction should see only intermediate states resulting from the operations of their own transaction, not the intermediate states of other transactions. The protocol allows participating objects to know what operations are being done within the scope of a transaction. However, it is up to the individual object to determine if such operations are to be reflected only within the scope of the transaction or can be seen by others who are not participating in the transaction.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="2737"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Durability:</em> The results of a transaction should be as persistent as the entity on which the transaction commits. However, such guarantees are up to the implementation of the object.
</ul>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="34891"> </a>The dependency on the participant's implementation for the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties is the greatest difference between this two-phase commit protocol and more traditional transaction processing systems. Such systems attempt to ensure that the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties are met and go to considerable trouble to ensure that no participant can violate any of the properties.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35154"> </a>This approach differs for both philosophical and practical reasons. The philosophical reason is centered on a basic tenet of object-oriented programming, which is that the implementation of an object should be hidden from any part of the system outside the object. Ensuring the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties generally requires that an object's implementation correspond to certain patterns. We believe that if these properties are needed, the object (or, more precisely, the programmer implementing the object) will know best how to guarantee the properties. For this reason, the manager is solely concerned with completing transactions properly. Clients and participants must agree on semantics separately.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3270"> </a>The practical reason for leaving the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties up to the object is that there are situations in which only some of the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties make sense, but that can still make use of the two-phase commit protocol. A group of transient objects might wish to group a set of operations in such a way that they appear atomic; in such a situation it makes little sense to require that the operations be durable. An object might want to enable the monitoring of the state of some long-running transactions; such monitoring would violate the isolation requirement of the <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">ACID</span> properties. Binding the two-phase commit protocol to all of these properties limits the use of such a protocol.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3273"> </a>We also know that particular semantics are needed for particular services. The default transaction semantics provide useful general-purpose semantics built on the two-phase commit completion protocol.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3271"> </a>Distributed transactions differ from single-system transactions in the same way that distributed computing differs from single-system computing. The clearest difference is that a single system can have a single view of the state of several services. It is possible in a single system to make it appear to any observer that all operations performed under a transaction have occurred or none have, thereby achieving isolation. In other words, no observer will ever see only part of the changes made under the transaction. In a distributed system it is possible for a client using two servers to see the committed state of a transaction in one server and the pre-committed state of the same transaction in another server. This can be prevented only by coordination with the transaction manager or the client that committed the transaction. Coordination between clients is outside the scope of this specification.

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7316"> </a>The participant had its state changed by operations performed under the transaction.

The record of changes must be at least as durable as the overall state of the participant. The record must also be examined during recovery (see <a href="txn-spec.html#7394">Section TX.2.8 "Crash Recovery"</a>) to ensure that the participant rolls forward or rolls back as the manager dictates. The participant stays in the <code>PREPARED</code> state until it is told to <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code>. It cannot, having returned <code>PREPARED</code>, drop the record except by following the "roll decision" described for crash recovery (see <a href="txn-spec.html#35649">Section TX.2.8.1 "The Roll Decision"</a>).
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7328"> </a>For nested transactions, when a participant returns <code>PREPARED</code> it is stating that it is ready to roll the changes forward into the parent transaction. The record of changes must be as durable as the record of changes for the parent transaction.

If <code>getState</code> throws a <code>RemoteException</code> the participant may choose to believe that the manager has crashed and abort its state in the transaction--this is not to be done lightly, since the manager may save state across crashes, and transient network failures could cause a participant to drop out of an otherwise valid and committable transaction. A participant should drop out of a transaction only if the manager is unreachable over an extended period. However, in no case should a participant drop out of a transaction it has <code>PREPARED</code> but not yet rolled forward.

At this point a participant that has dropped the information about the transaction will throw <code>UnknownTransactionException</code>, and the manager will be forced to abort.

</CENTER></p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="10547"> </a>When a transaction is created using <code>create</code>, the transaction is <code>ACTIVE</code>. This is the only state in which participants may <code>join</code> the transaction. Attempting to join the transaction in any other state throws a <code>CannotJoinException</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7382"> </a><em class="Emphasis"></em>Invoking the manager's <code>commit</code> method causes the manager to move to the <code>VOTING</code> state, in which it attempts to complete the transaction by rolling forward. Each participant that has joined the transaction has its <code>prepare</code> method invoked to vote on the outcome of the transaction. The participant may return one of three votes: <code>NOTCHANGED</code>, <code>ABORTED</code>, or <code>PREPARED</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7383"> </a>If a participant votes <code>ABORTED</code>, the manager must abort the transaction. If <code>prepare</code> throws <code>UnknownTransactionException</code> or <code>NoSuchObjectException</code>, the participant has lost its state of the transaction, and the manager must abort the transaction. If <code>prepare</code> throws <code>RemoteException</code>, the manager may retry as long as it wishes until it decides to abort the transaction.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7384"> </a>To abort the transaction, the manager moves to the <code>ABORTED</code> state. In the <code>ABORTED</code> state, the manager should invoke <code>abort</code> on all participants that have voted <code>PREPARED</code>. The manager should also attempt to invoke <code>abort</code> on all participants on which it has not yet invoked <code>prepare</code>. These notifications are not strictly necessary for the one-parameter forms of <code>commit</code> and <code>abort</code>, since the participants will eventually abort the transaction either by timing out or by asking the manager for the state of the transaction. However, informing the participants of the abort can speed up the release of resources in these participants, and so attempting the notification is strongly encouraged.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7385"> </a>If a participant votes <code>NOTCHANGED</code>, it is dropped from the list of participants, and no further communication will ensue. If all participants vote <code>NOTCHANGED</code> then the entire transaction was read-only and no participant has any changes to roll forward. The transaction moves to the <code>COMMITTED</code> state and then can immediately move to <em class="Emphasis">cleanup</em>, in which resources in the manager are cleaned up. There is no behavioral difference to a participant between a <code>NOTCHANGED</code> transaction and one that has completed the notification phase of the <code>COMMITTED</code> state.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35268"> </a>If no participant votes <code>ABORTED</code> and at least one participant votes <code>PREPARED</code>, the transaction also moves to the <code>COMMITTED</code> state. In the <code>COMMITTED</code> state the manager must notify each participant that returned <code>PREPARED</code> to roll forward by invoking the participant's <code>commit</code> method. When the participant's <code>commit</code> method returns normally, the participant has rolled forward successfully and the manager need not invoke <code>commit</code> on it again. As long as there exists at least one participant that has not rolled forward successfully, the manager must preserve the state of the transaction and repeat attempts to invoke <code>commit</code> at reasonable intervals. If a participant's <code>commit</code> method throws <code>UnknownTransactionException</code>, this means that the participant has already successfully rolled the transaction forward even though the manager did not receive the notification, either due to a network failure on a previous invocation that was actually successful or because the participant called <code>getState</code> directly.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7387"> </a>If the transaction is a nested one and the manager is prepared to roll the transaction forward, the members of the nested transaction must become members of the parent transaction. This <em class="Emphasis">promotion</em> of participants into the parent manager must be atomic--all must be promoted simultaneously, or none must be. The multi-participant <code>promote</code> method is designed for this use in the case in which the parent and nested transactions have different managers.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7388"> </a>The <code>promote</code> method takes arrays of participants and crash counts, where <code>crashCounts[i]</code> is the crash count for <code>parts[i]</code>. If any crash count is different from a crash count that is already known to the parent transaction manager, the parent manager throws <code>CrashCountException</code> and the parent transaction must abort. The <code>drop</code> parameter allows the nested transaction manager to drop itself out of the parent transaction as it promotes its participants into the parent transaction if it no longer has any need to be a participant itself.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7389"> </a>The manager for the nested transaction should remain available until it has successfully driven each participant to completion and promoted its participants into the parent transaction. If the nested transaction's manager disappears before a participant is positively informed of the transaction's completion, that participant will not know whether to roll forward or back, forcing it to vote <code>ABORTED</code> in the parent transaction. The manager may cease <code>commit</code> invocations on its participants if any parent transaction is aborted. Aborting any transaction implicitly aborts any uncommitted nested transactions. Additionally, since any committed nested transaction will also have its results dropped, any actions taken on behalf of that transaction can be abandoned.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7390"> </a>Invoking the manager's <code>abort</code> method, cancelling the transaction's lease, or allowing the lease to expire also moves the transaction to the <code>ABORTED</code> state. Any transactions nested inside that transaction are also moved directly to the <code>ABORTED</code> state.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7391"> </a>If all but one of the participants in a transaction have returned <code>NOTCHANGED</code>, the manager may optimize the <code>VOTING</code> state by invoking that participant's <code>prepareAndCommit</code> method. (Note that this includes the special case in which the transaction has exactly one participant.) If the manager receives an <code>ABORTED</code> result from <code>prepareAndCommit</code>, it proceeds to the <code>ABORTED</code> state. In effect, a <code>prepareAndCommit</code> moves through the <code>VOTING</code> state straight to operating on the results.
</p>
<p class="Body">
As previously noted, a call to <code>prepareAndCommit</code> might not be idempotent. If the manager receives a <code>RemoteException</code> because of network failure, but the participant has successfully moved to the <em>cleanup</em> stage, then the manager will be unable to determine the result of a previous <code>prepareAndCommit</code> call by simply retrying it. At this point, the participant has dropped the information about the transaction and will throw <code>UnknownTransactionException</code> on any retry attempt. When this occurs, the manager must indicate this condition by throwing a <code>RemoteException</code> back to the client. (Note that there is no added benefit of using <code>prepare</code> then <code>commit</code> versus <code>prepareAndCommit</code> in this case.)
</p>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="7392"> </a>A <code>getState</code> call on the manager can return any of <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>VOTING</code>, <code>ABORTED</code>, <code>NOTCHANGED</code>, or <code>COMMITTED</code>.

This storage must persist until all <code>PREPARED</code> participants successfully roll forward. A manager may choose to also store the list of <code>PREPARED</code> participants that have already successfully rolled forward or to rewrite the list of <code>PREPARED</code> participants as it shrinks, but this optimization is not required (although it is recommended as good citizenship). In the event of a manager crash, the list of participants must be recovered, and the manager must continue acting in the <code>COMMITTED</code> state until it can successfully notify all <code>PREPARED</code> participants.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7397"> </a>The participant also has one commit point, which is prior to voting <code>PREPARED</code>. When it votes <code>PREPARED</code>, the participant must have durably recorded the record of changes necessary to successfully roll forward in the event of a future invocation of <code>commit</code> by the manager.

</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7408"> </a>With multi-participant transactions it is entirely possible that different participants have different durability levels. The manager may be on a tightly replicated system with its durable storage duplicated on several host systems, giving a high degree of durability, while a participant may be using only one disk. Or a participant may always store its data in memory, expecting to lose it in a system crash (a database of people currently logged into the host, for example, need not survive a system crash). When humans make a decision to use a particular manager and set of participants for a transaction they must take into account these differences and be aware of the ramifications of committing changes that may be more durable on one participant than another. Determining, or even defining and exposing, varying levels of durability is outside the scope of this specification.

  <a name="7472"> </a>TX.3	 Default Transaction Semantics
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  The two-phase commit protocol defines how a transaction is created and later driven to completion by either committing or aborting. It is neutral with respect to the semantics of locking under the transaction or other behaviors that impart semantics to the use of the transaction. Specific clients and servers, however, must be written to expect specific transaction semantics. This model is to separate the completion protocol from transaction semantics, where transaction semantics are represented in the parameters and return values of methods by which clients and participants interact.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7475"> </a>This chapter defines the default transaction semantics of services.

  <a name="34097"> </a>TX.3.5	 Semantics
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7559"> </a>Activities that are performed as pure transactions (all access to shared mutable state is performed under transactional control) are subject to sequential ordering, meaning the overall effect of executing a set of sibling (all at the same level, whether top-level or nested) pure transactions concurrently is always equivalent to some sequential execution.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7560"> </a>Ancestor transactions can execute concurrently with child transactions, subject to the locking rules below.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7561"> </a>Transaction semantics for objects are defined in terms of strict two-phase locking. Every transactional operation is described in terms of acquiring locks on objects; these locks are held until the transaction completes. The most typical locks are read and write locks, but others are possible. Whatever the lock types are, conflict rules are defined such that if two operations do not commute, then they acquire conflicting locks. For objects using standard read and write locks, read locks do not conflict with other read locks, but write locks conflict with both read locks and other write locks. A transaction can acquire a lock if the only conflicting locks are those held by ancestor transactions (or itself). If a necessary lock cannot be acquired and the operation is defined to proceed without waiting for that lock, then serializability might be violated. When a subtransaction commits, its locks are inherited by the parent transaction.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35351"> </a>In addition to locks, transactional operations can be defined in terms of object creation and deletion visibility. If an object is defined to be created under a transaction, then the existence of the object is visible only within that transaction and its inferiors, but will disappear if the transaction aborts. If an object is defined to be deleted under a transaction, then the object is not visible to any transaction (including the deleting transaction) but will reappear if the transaction aborts. When a nested transaction commits, visibility state is inherited by the parent transaction.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7563"> </a>Once a transaction reaches the <code>VOTING</code> stage, if all execution under the transaction (and its subtransactions) has finished, then the only reasons the transaction can abort are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7564"> </a>The manager crashes (or has crashed) <p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7565"> </a>One or more participants crash (or have crashed)<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7566"> </a>There is an explicit abort
</ul>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7567"> </a>Transaction deadlocks are not guaranteed to be prevented or even detected, but managers and participants are permitted to break known deadlocks by aborting transactions.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35360"> </a>An active transaction is an <em class="Emphasis">orphan</em> if it or one of its ancestors is guaranteed to abort. This can occur because an ancestor has explicitly aborted or because some participant or manager of the transaction or an ancestor has crashed. Orphans are not guaranteed to be detected by the system, so programmers using transactions must be aware that orphans can see internally inconsistent state and take appropriate action.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="35367"> </a>Causal ordering information about transactions is not guaranteed to be propagated. First, given two sibling transactions (at any level), it is not possible to tell whether they were created concurrently or sequentially (or in what order). Second, if two transactions are causally ordered and the earlier transaction has completed, the outcome of the earlier transaction is not guaranteed to be known at every participant used by the later transaction, unless the client is successful in using the variant of <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> that takes a timeout parameter. Programmers using non-blocking forms of operations must take this into account.Furthermore, the default semantics do not require the participants to implement atomic versions of <code>commit</code> and <code>abort</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7570"> </a>As long as a transaction persists in attempting to acquire a lock that conflicts with another transaction, the participant will persist in attempting to resolve the outcome of the transaction that holds the conflicting lock. Attempts to acquire a lock include making a blocking call, continuing to make non-blocking calls, and registering for event notification under a transaction.
