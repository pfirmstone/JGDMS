<h2><a name="7185"></a>LS - River Lookup Attribute Schema Specification</h2>
<h3 class="Heading2">
  <a name="7186"> </a>LS.1	 Introduction	 
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3780"> </a>The River lookup service provides facilities for services to advertise their availability and for would-be clients to obtain references to those services based on the attributes they provide. The mechanism that it provides for registering and querying based on attributes is centered on the Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> platform type system, and is based on the notion of an <em class="Emphasis">entry.</em>
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3751"> </a>An entry is a class that contains a number of public fields of object type. Services provide concrete values for each of these fields; each value acts as an attribute. Entries thus provide aggregation of attributes into sets; a service may provide several entries when registering itself in the lookup service, which means that attributes on each service are provided in a set of sets.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3758"> </a>The purpose of this document is to provide a framework in which services and their would-be clients can interoperate. This framework takes two parts:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3768"> </a>We describe a set of common predefined entries that span much of the basic functionality that is needed both by services registering themselves and by entities that are searching for services.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3776"> </a>Since we cannot anticipate all of the future needs of clients of the lookup service, we provide a set of guidelines and design patterns for extending, using, and imitating this set in ways that are consistent and predictable. We also construct some examples that illustrate the use of these patterns.
</ul>

<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="3779"> </a>LS.1.1	 Terminology
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3781"> </a>Throughout this document, we will use the following terms in consistent ways:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3782"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Service</em>--a service that has registered, or will register, itself with the lookup service<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3787"> </a><em class="Emphasis">Client</em>--an entity that performs queries on the lookup service, in order to find particular services
</ul>

<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="3811"> </a>LS.1.2	 Design Issues
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3812"> </a>Several factors influence and constrain the design of the lookup service schema.
</p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 13pt; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: -36pt; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">
<a name="3817"> </a>Matching Cannot Always Be Automated<br>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3820"> </a>No matter how much information it has at its disposal, a client of the lookup service will not always be able to find a single unique match without assistance when it performs a lookup. In many instances we expect that more than one service will match a particular query. Accordingly, both the lookup service and the attribute schema are geared toward reducing the number of matches that are returned on a given lookup to a minimum, and not necessarily to just one.
</p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 13pt; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: -36pt; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">
<a name="3821"> </a>Attributes Are Mostly Static<br>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3824"> </a>We have designed the schema for the lookup service with the assumption that most attributes will not need to be changed frequently. For example, we do not expect attributes to change more often than once every minute or so. This decision is based on our expectation that clients that need to make a choice of service based on more frequently updated attributes will be able to talk to whatever small set of services the lookup service returns for a query, and on our belief that the benefit of updating attributes frequently at the lookup service is outweighed by the cost in network traffic and processing.
</p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 13pt; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: -36pt; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">
<a name="3834"> </a>Humans Need to Understand Most Attributes<br>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3835"> </a>A corollary of the idea that matching cannot always be automated is that humans--whether they be users or administrators of services--must be able to understand and interpret attributes. This has several implications:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3840"> </a>We must provide a mechanism to deal with localization of attributes<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3847"> </a>Multiple-valued attributes must provide a way for humans to see only one value (see <a href="schema-spec.html#7189">Section&nbsp;LS.2, "Human Access to Attributes"</a>)
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="3848"> </a>We will cover human accessibility of attributes soon.
</p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 13pt; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: -36pt; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">
<a name="3857"> </a>Attributes Can Be Changed by Services or Humans, But Not Both<br>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3860"> </a>For any given attribute class we expect that attributes within that class will all be set or modified either by the service, or via human intervention, but not both. What do we mean by this? A service is unlikely to be able to determine that it has been moved from one room to another, for example, so we would not expect the fields of a "location" attribute class to be changed by the service itself. Similarly, we do not expect that a human operator will need to change the name of the vendor of a particular service. This idea has implications for our approach to ensuring that the values of attributes are valid.
</p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-left: 36pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 13pt; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: -36pt; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">
<a name="3880"> </a>Attributes Must Interoperate with JavaBeans<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Components<br>
</div>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3881"> </a>The JavaBeans<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> specification provides a number of facilities relating to the localized display and modification of properties, and has been widely adopted. It is to our advantage to provide a familiar set of mechanisms for manipulating attributes in these ways.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="3937"> </a>LS.1.3	 Dependencies
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="3938"> </a>This document relies on the following other specifications:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="3940"> </a><a href="entry-spec.html"><em class="Emphasis">River Entry Specification</em></a> <p>

</ul>


<h3 class="Heading2">
  <a name="7189"> </a>LS.2	 Human Access to Attributes	 
</h3>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="7190"> </a>LS.2.1	 Providing a Single View of an Attribute's Value
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7191"> </a>Consider the following entry class:
</p>
<pre  class="Preformatted">
public class Foo implements net.jini.core.entry.Entry {
    public Bar baz;
}

public class Bar {
    int quux;
    boolean zot;
}
</code></pre>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="10587"> </a>A visual search tool is going to have a difficult time rendering the value of an instance of class <code>Bar</code> in a manner that is comprehensible to humans. Accordingly, to avoid such situations, entry class implementors should use the following guidelines when designing a class that is to act as a value for an attribute:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7201"> </a>Provide a property editor class of the appropriate type, as described in Section 9.2 of the <em class="Emphasis">JavaBeans Specification</em>.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="31176"> </a>Extend the <code>java.awt.Component</code> class; this allows a value to be represented by a JavaBeans component or some other "active" object.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="31177"> </a>Provide either a non-default implementation of the <code>Object.toString</code> method or inherit directly or indirectly from a class that does so (since the default implementation of <code>Object.toString </code>is not useful).
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="7204"> </a>One of the above guidelines should be followed for all attribute value classes. Authors of entry classes should assume that any attribute value that does not satisfy one of these guidelines will be ignored by some or all user interfaces.
</p>

</h3>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="7214"> </a>LS.3.1	 Allowing Display and Modification of Attributes
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7215"> </a>We use JavaBeans components to provide a layer of abstraction on top of the individual classes that implement the <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</code> interface. This provides us with several benefits:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7216"> </a>This approach uses an existing standard and thus reduces the amount of unfamiliar material for programmers.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7217"> </a>JavaBeans components provide mechanisms for localized display of attribute values and descriptions.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7218"> </a>Modification of attributes is also handled, via property editors.
</ul>

<h5 class="Heading4">
  <a name="7219"> </a>LS.3.1.1	 Using JavaBeans Components with Entry Classes
</h5>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7220"> </a>Many, if not most, entry classes should have a bean class associated with them. Our use of JavaBeans components provides a familiar mechanism for authors of browse/search tools to represent information about a service's attributes, such as its icons and appropriately localized descriptions of the meanings and values of its attributes. JavaBeans components also play a role in permitting administrators of a service to modify some of its attributes, as they can manipulate the values of its attributes using standard JavaBeans component mechanisms.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="31182"> </a>For example, obtaining a <code>java.beans.BeanDescriptor</code> for a JavaBeans component that is linked to a "location" entry object for a particular service allows a programmer to obtain an icon that gives a visual indication of what that entry class is for, along with a short textual description of the class and the values of the individual attributes in the location object. It also permits an administrative tool to view and change certain fields in the location, such as the floor number.
</p>
<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="7222"> </a>LS.3.2	 Associating JavaBeans Components with Entry Classes
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7223"> </a>The pattern for establishing a link between an entry object and an instance of its JavaBeans component is simple enough, as this example illustrates:
</p>
<pre  class="Preformatted">
package org.example.foo;

import java.io.Serializable;
import net.jini.lookup.entry.EntryBean;
import net.jini.entry.AbstractEntry;

public class Size {
    public int value;
}

public class Cavenewt extends AbstractEntry {
    public Cavenewt() {
    }
    public Cavenewt(Size anvilSize) {
        this.anvilSize = anvilSize;
    }
    public Size anvilSize;
}

public class CavenewtBean implements EntryBean, Serializable {
    protected Cavenewt assoc;
    public CavenewtBean() {
        super();
        assoc = new Cavenewt();
    }
    public void setAnvilSize(Size x) {
        assoc.anvilSize = x;
    }
    public Size getAnvilSize() {
        return assoc.anvilSize;
    }
    public void makeLink(Entry obj) {
         assoc = (Cavenewt) obj;
    }
    public Entry followLink() {
        return assoc;
    }
}
</pre>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="30162"> </a>From the above, the pattern should be relatively clear:
</p>
<ul>

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7263"> </a>The name of a JavaBeans component is derived by taking the fully qualified entry class name and appending the string <code>Bean</code>; for example, the name of the JavaBeans component associated with the entry class <code>foo.bar.Baz</code> is <code>foo.bar.BazBean</code>. This implies that an entry class and its associated JavaBeans component must reside in the same package.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7264"> </a>The class has both a public no-arg constructor and a public constructor that takes each public object field of the class and its superclasses as parameter. The former constructs an empty instance of the class, and the latter initializes each field of the new instance to the given parameter.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7265"> </a>The class implements the <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</code> interface, preferably by extending the <code>net.jini.entry.AbstractEntry</code> class, and the JavaBeans component implements the <code>net.jini.lookup.entry.EntryBean</code> interface.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7266"> </a>There is a one-to-one link between a JavaBeans component and a particular entry object. The <code>makeLink</code> method establishes this link and will throw an exception if the association is with an entry class of the wrong type. The <code>followLink</code> method returns the entry object associated with a particular JavaBeans component.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7267"> </a>The no-arg public constructor for a JavaBeans component creates and makes a link to an empty entry object.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7268"> </a>For each public object field <code class="CodeEmphasis">foo</code> in an entry class, there exist both a <code>set</code><code class="CodeEmphasis">Foo</code> and a <code>getFoo</code> method in the associated JavaBeans component. The <code>set</code><code class="CodeEmphasis">Foo</code> method takes a single argument of the same type as the <code class="CodeEmphasis">foo</code> field in the associated entry and sets the value of that field to its argument. The <code>get</code><code class="CodeEmphasis">Foo</code> method returns the value of that field.
</ul>

<h4 class="Heading3">
  <a name="7269"> </a>LS.3.3	 Supporting Interfaces and Classes
</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7270"> </a>The following classes and interfaces provide facilities for handling entry classes and their associated JavaBeans components.
</p>
<pre  class="Preformatted">
package net.jini.lookup.entry;

public class EntryBeans {
    public static EntryBean createBean(Entry e)
        throws ClassNotFoundException, java.io.IOException {...}

    public static Class getBeanClass(Class c)
        throws ClassNotFoundException {...}
}

public interface EntryBean {
    void makeLink(Entry e);
    Entry followLink();
}
</pre>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="30550"> </a>The <code>EntryBeans</code> class cannot be instantiated. Its sole method, <code>createBean</code>, creates and initializes a new JavaBeans component and links it to the entry object it is passed. If a problem occurs creating the JavaBeans component, the method throws either <code>java.io.IOException</code> or <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7286"> </a>The <code>createBean</code> method uses the same mechanism for instantiating a JavaBeans component as the <code>java.beans.Beans.instantiate</code> method. It will initially try to instantiate the JavaBeans component using the same class loader as the entry it is passed. If that fails, it will fall back to using the default class loader.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7287"> </a>The <code>getBeanClass</code> method returns the class of the JavaBeans component associated with the given attribute class. If the class passed in does not implement the <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry</code> interface, an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown. If the given attribute class cannot be found, a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> is thrown.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7288"> </a>The <code>EntryBean</code> interface must be implemented by all JavaBeans components that are intended to be linked to entry objects. The <code>makeLink</code> method establishes a link between a JavaBeans component object and an entry object, and the <code>followLink</code> method returns the entry object linked to by a particular JavaBeans component. Note that objects that implement the <code>EntryBean</code> interface should not be assumed to perform any internal synchronization in their implementations of the <code>makeLink</code> or <code>followLink</code> methods, or in the <code>setFoo</code> or <code>getFoo</code> patterns.

  <a name="7313"> </a>LS.4	 Generic Attribute Classes	 
</h3>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="7314"> </a>We will now describe some attribute classes that are generic to many or all services and the JavaBeans components that are associated with each. Unless otherwise stated, all classes defined here live in the <code>net.jini.lookup.entry </code>package. The definitions assume the following classes to have been imported:

</h4>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="31205"> </a>To indicate that certain entry classes should only be modified by the service that registered itself with instances of these entry classes, we annotate them with the <code>ServiceControlled</code> interface.

<pre  class="Preformatted">

<p class="Body">
  <a name="10489"> </a>Authors of administrative tools that modify fields of attribute objects at the lookup service should not permit users to either modify any fields or add any new instances of objects that implement this interface.

  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7356"> </a>The <code>manufacturer</code> field provides the name of the company that "built" this service. This might be a hardware manufacturer or a software authoring company.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7357"> </a>The <code>vendor</code> field contains the name of the company that sells the software or hardware that provides this service. This may be the same name as is in the <code>manufacturer</code> field, or it could be the name of a reseller. This field exists so that in cases in which resellers relabel products built by other companies, users will be able to search based on either name.<p>
  <li class="SmartList1"><a name="7358"> </a>The <code>version</code> field provides information about the version of this service. It is a free-form field, though we expect that service implementors will follow normal version-naming conventions in using it.<p>

The <code>getDisplayName</code> and <code>getShortDescription</code> methods return a localized human-readable name and description for the service, in the same manner as their counterparts in the <code>java.beans.FeatureDescriptor</code> class.
