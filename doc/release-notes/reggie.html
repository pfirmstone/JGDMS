<title>Release Notes for com.sun.jini.reggie</title>

<center>
<h1>Reggie<br>
v2.1.1 Release Notes</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<ul>
<h3>Description</h3>
"Reggie" is the name of the contributed Jini lookup service implementation
from Sun Microsystems. The specification for the Jini lookup service is 
available in <a href="../specs/html/lookup-spec.html">HTML</a>.
<p/>
The specification for Reggie is defined not only by the <i>Jini Lookup Service
Specification</i>, but also by the API documentation (generated by the 
Javadoc(TM) tool) for <a href="../api/net/jini/admin/Administrable.html">
<code>Administrable</code></a>.
<p/>

<h3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Handling of Evolved Types</b></dt>
    <dd>
	Consider the case where service <code>S</code> has been deployed in a 
	network, and <code>S</code> needs to be modified to implement 
	a new interface.  Let's call the modified service <code>S'</code>.
	In previous versions of Reggie, a client would not find a proxy to 
	<code>S'</code> when doing a lookup by the new interface unless 
	the <code>S'</code> proxy class was renamed.  This version of Reggie 
	allows a client to find a proxy to <code>S'</code> when doing a 
	lookup by the new interface, even if the name of the proxy class has 
	not been changed and there are instances of <code>S</code> already 
	registered.<p/>		
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Reuse of Multicast Announcements</b></dt>
    <dd>
	Reggie now reuses multicast announcements when there are no changes
	in host, port, or group information in order to minimize the expense of
	signing announcement packets in deployments that have been configured
	to use secure discovery.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Delayed Verification of Multicast Requests</b></dt>
    <dd>
 	Reggie also delays verifying signatures on multicast requests until 
	it can determine that it must reply to the request.  This minimizes
	the expense of verifying signatures in deployments configured with
	secure discovery.<p/>	
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Socket Connection Timeout when Replying to a Multicast 
	Request</b></dt>
    <dd>
	This version of Reggie allows a deployer to specify a timeout to be
	applied when establishing a connection to the multicast response
	server of a client attempting to discover Reggie.  The timeout can
	be specified by adding a 
	<a href="../api/net/jini/core/constraint/ConnectionRelativeTime.html">
	<code>ConnectionRelativeTime</code></a> constraint to Reggie's 
	<code>discoveryConstraints</code>.  For information on additional
	constraints supported by Reggie, refer to 
	<a href="../api/com/sun/jini/reggie/package-summary.html">
	<code>Reggie's manual pages</code></a>
	<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Modifications to Reggie's Proxies</b></dt>
    <dd>
	Reggie's 
        <a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceRegistrar.html">
	<code>ServiceRegistrar</code></a>, 
	<a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceRegistration.html">
	<code>ServiceRegistration</code></a>, 
	<a href="../api/net/jini/core/lease/Lease.html"> 
	<code>Lease</code></a>, and admin proxies now override 
    	<code>java.lang.Object.toString()</code> to facilitate debugging by
	providing additional information, like Reggie's 
	<a href="../api/net/jini/core/lookup/ServiceID.html">
	<code>ServiceID</code></a> and underlying Java (TM) Remote Method
	Invocation (Java RMI) stub.<p/> 
	The communication protocol used between Reggie and its main proxy 
	has been modified to enable handling of evolved types.  This new
	protocol is not compatible with that of earlier releases.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Log File Format</b></dt>
    <dd>
	The log file format used by the persistent version of Reggie in this 
	release is not compatible with that of earlier releases.<p/>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Bug Fixes</b></dt>
    <dd>
    	<ul>
            <li>
		<i>4939735 - Reggie doesn't refresh self-registration on 
		restart</i><br/>
		The persistent version of reggie no longer stores its 
		self-registration; rather, the self-registration is recreated
            	each time reggie is restarted to allow for configuration or
		export changes to be reflected in the proxy reggie registers
		with itself.
            </li>
            <li>
		<i>5002218 - Reggie should properly handle remote calls that
		arrive before initialization is complete</i><br/>
		Calls that arrive while reggie is in the process 
		of initializing will now block until reggie has completed its
		initialization.  Calls that arrive after reggie has commenced
		its shutdown process will now result in a 
		<code>java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException</code>.
            </li>
	</ul>
    </dd>
