<title>Release Notes for ClassDep</title>

<h1><code>ClassDep</code><br>
Apache River v2.1.2 Release Notes</h1>
</center>
<HR>
<UL>
<H3>Description</H3>
<code>ClassDep</code> is used to analyze a set of classes and determine on
what other classes they directly or indirectly depend.
<H3>Changes since the v2.1.1 release</H3>
<dl>
    The new implementation no longer depends upon the Java SDK <code>tools.jar</code>
    library, <a href ="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> is now used to provide 
    equivalent and extended functionality, including detecting dependencies
    from Annotations and Generics.  Note that if a static class (nested class)
    is included in the dependency graph, references from that static class to
    its immediate lexically enclosing class are included in the dependency
    search now by default.
</dl>

<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-7'>RIVER-7</a>] -         
com.sun.jini.tool.ClassDep should be smarter with outer classes
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-8'>RIVER-8</a>] -         
com.sun.jini.tool.ClassDep empty inside collection doesn't work
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-78'>RIVER-78</a>] -         
ClassDep generates duplicate output lines
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-82'>RIVER-82</a>] -         
ClassDep generates duplicate output lines
</li>
<li>[<a href='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RIVER-302'>RIVER-302</a>] -         
ClassDep -newdirbehaviour option does not work
</li>


<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Executable JAR file</b>
<dd>There is a new executable JAR file, <code>classdep.jar</code>,
that can be used to run <code>ClassDep</code>. The advantage of using
this JAR file is that it automatically loads <code>tools.jar</code>
from your Java(TM) 2 SDK installation, if required.
