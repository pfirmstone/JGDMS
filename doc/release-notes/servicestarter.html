<title>Release Notes for Service Starter</title>

<h1><code>com.sun.jini.start</code><br>
v2.1.1 Release Notes</h1>

<HR>
<UL>
<H3>Description</H3>
The Service Starter package is a collection of utilities and APIs 
used to launch the contributed services provided in the 
Apache River release.

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Bug Fixes of Interest</b></dt>
  <dd> The following bugs have been addressed in this release:
  <p>
  <dl>
  <dt><b>
      4835830: Add per-service proxy preparer support
      </b></dt>
  <dd>Per-service proxy preparer support has been added to 
      <code>NonActivatableServiceDescriptor</code> and 
      <code>SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor</code> via constructor
      overloads that take proxy preparer parameters. This allows users
      to individually prepare the service proxies returned by service
      starter framework.
      <P>
  <dt><b>
      4856937: Service starter should permit specifying dynamic policy provider
      </b></dt>
  <dd><code>ActivateWrapper</code> supports the
      the <code>java.security.Security</code> property
      <code>com.sun.jini.start.servicePolicyProvider</code>, which allows users
      to specify the fully qualified class name of a dynamic policy provider to
      use for wrapping individual service policies in a "shared" environment.
      A custom service policy provider can be very useful when trying to
      debug security related issues. See the start package documentation for
      more detail.
      <P>
  <dt><b>
      4858623: change ExportClassLoader to use context class loader for parent
      </b></dt>
  <dd><code>ActivateWrapper.ExportClassLoader</code> now uses the calling context's 
      class loader as its parent (versus the application classpath, used previously).
      This allows "container" applications more control over the class loader 
      hierarchy used when launching services.
      <P>
  <dt><b>
      6211452: change ActivateWrapper.ExportClassLoader to subclass PreferredClassLoader
      </b></dt>
  <dd><code>ActivateWrapper.ExportClassLoader</code> now extends 
      <code>PreferredClassLoader</code> instead of <code>URLClassLoader</code>.
      A service can now specify a preferred list for its import class path, 
      to ensure that any classes that need to be annotated with the server's 
      codebase get loaded by the server's class loader rather than accidentally 
      being resolved in the container.
      <P>
  <dt><b>
      4868839: Make utility class constructors private
      </b></dt>
  <dd>The following utility classes simply contain static methods and
      are not meant to be instantiated: 
      <UL>
      <LI><code>ClassLoaderUtil</code>
      <LI><code>DestroySharedGroup</code>
      <LI><code>HTTPDStatus</code>
      </UL>
      To ensure this, private constructors have been added to each of the
      above classes.
      <P>
  <dt><b>
      4936006: ServiceDescriptor's should support non-file-based classpath entries
      </b></dt>
  <dd>The <code>importCodebase</code> parameter in the constructors for 
      <code>NonActivatableServiceDescriptor</code> and 
      <code>SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor</code> now support either:
      <UL>
      <LI>a space delimited set of <code>URL</code>(s) representing a codebase or
      <LI>a <code>File.pathSeparator</code> delimited set of class paths. 
      <UL>
      <P>
