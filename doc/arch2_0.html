<center><h1>Jini Specification Important Additions<br>
    River-Internet Release v3.0.0-b1</h1></center>

<br>

<p>This document provides an overview of the implementation details of
Jini Specification Additions included in Apache River and
explains how these components fit together.  Much of this
information is available in the package, interface, and class
documentation, but this document provides a higher-level overview
and indicates where to find more information.


<h2>1 Overview of Jini Architecture</h2>

<p>The Jini system architecture consists of three categories:
<i>programming model</i>, <i>infrastructure</i>, and <i>services</i>.

<p>Apache River provides the following Jini service implementations:

<ul>
<li> Lookup Service (reggie)
<li> Transaction Manager Service (mahalo)
<li> Lease Renewal Service (norm)
<li> Event Mailbox Service (mercury)
<li> Lookup Discovery Service (fiddler)
<li> JavaSpaces Service (outrigger)
</ul>

<p>Apache River releases and the Jini v2.0 release provide additional
components to the first two
categories (programming model and infrastructure) of the Jini
architecture.  The component additions can be summarized as follows:

<p><i>Additions to Programming Models</i>

<li><a href="api/org/apache/river/discovery/package-summary.html">Discovery Protocol v2</a>
</ul>

<p><i>Configuring Services</i>

<p>Each service included in Apache River supports being
configured using a <code>Configuration</code>.  Most of the
services were previously configured via system properties.  These
services can now be configured via entries in the configuration.
New types of behavior that can be configured are remote service
exporting and proxy preparation.</p>

<h3>1.1 Goals</h3>

The main goals for the additions in the Jini architecture are to:

<ul>
<li> Add support for secure Jini technology-based programs (Security infrastructure)
<li> Provide mechanisms to configure applications (<code>Configuration</code>)
<li> Unify client-side and server-side programming models
     (<code>ProxyPreparer</code> and <code>Exporter</code>)
<li> Provide a Java(TM) Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI)
     implementation that supports pluggable invocation layer behavior
     and pluggable transport providers (Jini ERI)
</ul>

<p>The primary motivation for augmenting the Jini architecture
is to provide the new programming models and infrastructure
necessary to support and manage security in Jini technology-based
distributed applications.  The previous Jini architecture lacked
direct support for a type of security many Jini / Apache River applications
need, namely basic network security for remote calls to
services.  This goal is addressed by the new security
infrastructure and constraint-based remote invocation model.

<p>Another important goal for this release is to better unify the
overall programming model for service developers, given the
previous lack of uniformity in the APIs for implementing,
exporting, and deploying services.  Securing remote invocation
requires additional client-side verification steps, so this
release introduces a uniform client-side API to handle a
"preparation" step before remote invocation.  Additionally,
application developers can ease deployment tasks by separating
out deployment-time information from the application.  The
<code>Configuration</code> API introduced in the Jini 2.0 release
provides a simple and uniform way to obtain deployment-specific
information.  The resulting programming model supports a uniform
framework for pluggable security, exporter, transport, and other
service providers.

<p>A final goal is to provide an implementation of the Java RMI
programming model that supports constraints on remote invocation
(which is crucial to the security model), and supports pluggable
invocation and dispatch behavior as well as pluggable transport
providers on a per-object basis, features which are lacking in the
JRMP implementation of Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition (J2SE(TM)) RMI.
The Jini ERI API provides such a pluggable implementation of the Java
RMI programming model.


<h2>2 Programming Model</h2>

<p>Before delving into the discussion of the security
architecture, it is important to understand initially a few
additional programming models, <code>Configuration</code>,
<code>Exporter</code>, and <code>ProxyPreparer</code>, each of
which simplifies application development in general and secure
application development in particular.

<h3>2.1 <code>Configuration</code> </h3>

An application is much easier to test, deploy, and evolve
when the application's source code is not tied directly to specific
deployments, but instead uses a level of abstraction, such as
service provider interfaces.  Such applications may separate out
deployment-specific information from the application source code,
allowing this information to be configured at deployment time.  The
obvious benefit of this approach is that the application can be
configured to use the implementations that the deployment requires
without having to change the application source code.  If
deployment needs change, only the configuration must change;  the
application can remain intact.

<p>The <code>net.jini.config.Configuration</code> API supports this
approach by providing a simple, uniform way to obtain the objects
needed to configure an application.  An application can obtain an
object from a <code>Configuration</code> instead of explicitly
constructing an instance to avoid tying the application to
deployment-specific implementations.  Typical objects that should be
obtained from a configuration are <code>Exporter</code> and
<code>ProxyPreparer</code> instances (discussed below).

<p>An application may not want to be tied to a specific implementation
of <code>Configuration</code> either, so an application can use
<code>net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider</code> to obtain a
<code>Configuration</code> implementation.  Using the
<code>ConfigurationProvider</code> in an application allows the
application's deployer to specify the most suitable
<code>Configuration</code> implementation at deployment time.
A given <code>Configuration</code> implementation might
read configuration information from a file, a database,
or from some other source.

<p>The standard, default <code>Configuration</code> implementation is
<code>net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile</code>.  This implementation
reads configuration information, written in a subset of the syntax of
the Java programming language, from files and URLs to produce objects
from the configuration.  See the <a href="api/net/jini/config/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.config</code> package
documentation</a> for an example of how an application can use a
<code>Configuration</code> and how a deployer can use a
<code>ConfigurationFile</code> source file to configure that
application. 

<h3>2.2  <code>Exporter</code> and the Server-Side Implementation Model </h3>

<p>In Jini technology-based applications, invoking a method on a
Jini service proxy has a uniform client-side model: a client
simply invokes a method on the service's proxy to initiate remote
communication to the service object, an invocation that follows
the same general semantics as the Java RMI model.

<p>The server-side implementation model for Jini / Apache River applications,
however, is not uniform.  An application developer typically
implements a service and exports that service in a way that ties
the service directly to a specific implementation and model of
remote communication.  This implementation dependence requires
that the application source code be modified if the service needs
to be exported in a slightly different way. For example, an
application deployment may need to export a service to use a
different port or socket factory, or may need to export that
service using a different implementation of remote communication
entirely, such as a different implementation of the Java RMI
programming model.

<p>The <code>net.jini.export.Exporter</code> interface unifies the
server-side implementation model by providing an abstraction for
exporting and unexporting a remote object.  The details of export and
unexport behavior, including communication protocols used for remote
invocation and additional invocation semantics, are defined by the
particular implementation of the <code>Exporter</code> interface.

<p>Several standard <code>Exporter</code> implementations, which are
also implementations of the Java RMI programming model, are provided.  
The following table lists these
implementations along with the class whose behavior the exporter is
semantically equivalent to.

<p>
<blockquote>
<table summary="Describes the standard Exporter implementations"
       border=1 cellpadding=5>
<th> <code>Exporter</code> <th>Equivalent Class
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter</code>
     <td> <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.iiop.IiopExporter</code>
     <td> <code>javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject</code>
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter</code>
     <td> itself
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>An application can use a <code>Configuration</code> together with
the <code>Exporter</code> interface to export remote objects in a way
that can be configured at deployment time.  The following example
(similar to those in the <a href="api/net/jini/config/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.config.Configuration</code>
package documentation</a>) illustrates configurable exporting:

<pre>
    import java.rmi.*;
    import net.jini.config.*;
    import net.jini.export.*;
    public class Example implements Remote {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getInstance(args);
            Exporter exporter = (Exporter) config.getEntry(
                "Example", "exporter", Exporter.class);
            Remote proxy = exporter.export(new Example());
            System.out.println(proxy);
            exporter.unexport(true);
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This application can be configured by specifying the following
configuration file (that uses <code>ConfigurationFile</code>
syntax) as a command line argument.  The configuration file
specifies the exporter to be a <code>JrmpExporter</code>, an
exporter that produces proxies that participate in the JRMP
protocol.

<pre>
    import net.jini.jrmp.*;
    Example {
        exporter = new JrmpExporter();
    }
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the application can be deployed to specify the
exporter to be a <code>BasicJeriExporter</code> (an exporter for
exporting a remote object to use Jini ERI) constructed to export the
object on an anonymous TCP port.

<pre>
    import net.jini.jeri.*;
    import net.jini.jeri.tcp.*;
    Example {
        exporter = new BasicJeriExporter(TcpServerEndpoint.getInstance(0));
    }
</pre>

<h3>2.3  <code>ProxyPreparer</code> and the Client-Side Invocation Model </h3>

<p>The new security model (discussed below) requires the application
to perform some pre-invocation "preparation" of a service proxy before
invoking its methods.  This is because an application may receive the
service proxy from an untrusted source.  Therefore, before an
application uses a proxy, that application might need to perform
operations such as verifying trust in the proxy or granting
permissions to the proxy once its trust has been verified.

<p>These security requirements add an additional step to the
client-side invocation model.  The
<code>net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer</code> interface abstracts the
operation of "proxy preparation" into a single method,
<code>prepareProxy</code>, so that the client-side invocation model
can be uniform across applications using secure and non-secure
proxies.

<p>A <code>ProxyPreparer</code> can be used together with a
<code>Configuration</code> to allow configurable proxy preparation.
The following is a code snippet from the <a
href="../source/src/org/apache/river/example/hello/index.html"><i>hello</i>
example</a> client, which is part of a comprehensive example included
in the Apache River release:

<p>
<pre>
    ProxyPreparer preparer = (ProxyPreparer) config.getEntry(
        "org.apache.river.example.hello.Client",
	"preparer", ProxyPreparer.class, new BasicProxyPreparer());
    server = (Hello) preparer.prepareProxy(server);
    System.out.println("Server says: " + server.sayHello());
</pre>

<p>The call to <code>getEntry</code> supplies a default (<code>new
BasicProxyPreparer()</code>) for the entry that will be returned if
the configuration file does not have the specified entry.  A
<code>net.jini.security.BasicProxyPreparer</code> instance can be
constructed with arguments specifying whether a proxy, passed to its
<code>prepareProxy</code> method, needs to be verified or needs other
security-related operations to be performed.  A
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> constructed with no arguments, which
is the default above, specifies a "do nothing"
<code>ProxyPreparer</code> that simply returns the proxy passed to the
<code>prepareProxy</code> method.

<p>If an application deployment has security requirements, the
application can be deployed with a <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code>
constructed with the appropriate arguments or can be
deployed with an alternate <code>ProxyPreparer</code> implementation.


<h2>3 Security</h2>

<p>In a typical Jini technology-based application, a client obtains a
service proxy from somewhere (for example, from a lookup service or as
a result of communicating with another service) and then invokes
methods on that proxy to communicate with the service.  Many
applications have a need to secure such remote communication,
requiring one or more of the following:

<ul>
<li> Mutual authentication (client and server)
<li> Authorization (access control)
<li> Integrity (cryptographic checksums)
<li> Confidentiality (encryption)
</ul>

<p>These requirements are typical for securing <i>data</i>
communication; however, the Jini security model has an additional
requirement: <i>code</i> integrity.  In the Jini and Java RMI model,
an object's data is sent in a remote invocation, but its code is
downloaded out-of-band as a result of that remote invocation.  An
application needs to establish trust for the <i>objects</i> it
receives, both in the integrity of an object's code as well as in its
data.

<p>This release provides a framework for trust verification as well as
a constraint-based remote invocation model that enables an application
to specify various requirements (such as security requirements) on
remote invocations.  The infrastructure also provides mechanisms that
can be used to ensure code integrity.

<h3>3.1 Constraints and Remote Invocation</h3>

<p>The security requirements described above can be expressed as
<i>constraints</i> on remote invocation.  A constraint is a specific
requirement, set by the client, on the behavior of remote invocations
through a proxy to its associated service.  A proxy can implement the
interface <code>net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl</code> to
enable a client to set constraints on remote invocation through
that proxy.  The constraint-based remote invocation model is general,
providing for security-related constraint types as well as other
constraint types.

<p>One example use of constraints is a client that needs to authenticate
the identity of a service (such as a bank) before communicating with
it through its proxy.  In this example, the service proxy can
implement the interface <code>RemoteMethodControl</code> to enable a
client to set a constraint requiring server authentication on any
remote invocation through that proxy.  It is the proxy's
responsibility to satisfy those constraints, but it is the client's
responsibility to verify that it can trust the proxy to carry out its
responsibility (discussed below).

<p>Each constraint is represented as a
<code>net.jini.core.constraint.InvocationConstraint</code> instance.
An <code>InvocationConstraint</code> instance expresses "what" but not
"how"; that is, a constraint expresses "what" the constraint
represents, but not "how" the constraint should be satisfied.  A proxy
is responsible for using the appropriate transport and protocols to
satisfy the constraints set by the client.  Because constraints are
expressed abstractly, the security implementations are pluggable and
thus are capable of supporting a wide variety of protocols such as
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Kerberos.  See the
<a href="api/net/jini/core/constraint/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.core.constraint</code> package documentation</a> for
general information on constraints including a number of pre-defined
basic constraints.

<p>Before a client sets constraints on a proxy, the client first needs
to verify that it can trust the proxy to carry out the constraints to
be set, because the proxy may have been received from an untrusted
source.  If the client does not verify that the proxy is trusted,
there is a danger that the proxy could simply ignore the client's
constraints and perform unencrypted data transfer, misrepresent the
client's or server's identity, or worse.  After the client verifies
trust in the proxy, it can then set constraints on the proxy to
specify any desired security requirements, such as server
authentication.

<p>Once a client trusts a proxy, it may also need to grant additional
permissions to the proxy, over and above the minimal permissions
typically configured in advance for untrusted code, so that future
invocations through the proxy function properly.  A proxy may require
<code>net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission</code> so that it can
authenticate with the server, for example.  A client must not grant
permissions to the proxy before it trusts the proxy, so that the proxy
cannot abuse the grants in a way that might cause harm.

<p>To summarize, a client receiving a proxy from an untrusted source
needs to "prepare" the proxy in the following manner before invoking
that proxy's methods.  The full requirements for each of these steps
are described in the <a href="api/net/jini/security/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.security</code> package documentation</a>:

<ul>
<li>Verify trust in the proxy
<li>Grant permissions to the proxy
<li>Set constraints on (a copy of) the proxy
</ul>

<p>The steps above can be encapsulated in a single operation known as
<i>proxy preparation</i>, a term which means "preparing the proxy for
remote invocation".  The client-side interface
<code>net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer</code> (discussed above)
encapsulates such proxy preparation into a single method,
<code>prepareProxy</code>.

<p>The class <code>net.jini.security.BasicProxyPreparer</code>, a
standard implementation of the <code>ProxyPreparer</code> interface,
performs the three necessary steps above to prepare a proxy for secure
remote calls.  Most deployers can use a
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> instance for proxy preparation and not
worry about all the details behind trust verification (which are
outlined in some detail below).  Other applications may need to subclass
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> if verifying trust, setting
constraints, and/or granting permissions require some customization.


<h3>3.2 Proxy Preparation Using <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code></h3>


<p>The <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> class encapsulates the three steps
of verifying trust, setting constraints, and granting permissions to a
proxy.  A <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> instance can be constructed
in a variety of ways, supporting many common cases for proxy
preparation including the following:

<ul>

<li> <i>Verify trust, grant permissions, and set new constraints</i>:
to prepare a proxy received from an untrusted source.

<li> <i>Set new constraints</i>: to prepare a trusted proxy received
with integrity protection from a trusted source that is not known to
supply the appropriate constraints.

<li> <i>Grant permissions</i>: to prepare a trusted proxy received
with integrity protection from a trusted source that supplies
appropriate constraints, if the proxy needs permission grants.

<li> <i>Do nothing</i>: to use as a default when retrieving an
optional configuration entry, or to prepare a non-secure proxy.

</ul>

<p>Static methods <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code> and
<code>Security.grant</code> of the
<code>net.jini.security.Security</code> class implement the trust
verification and permission granting mechanisms, respectively.
Constraints can be set on the proxy implementing the
<code>RemoteMethodControl</code> interface by calling its
<code>setConstraints</code> method.  A
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> uses these three mechanisms to
implement the specifics of proxy preparation.

<p>The next three sections describe the mechanics of proxy preparation
using a <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> instance that performs all three
steps.  For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that a
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> is constructed as follows:

<pre>
    new BasicProxyPreparer(true, <i>constraints</i>, <i>permissions</i>)
</pre>

<p>where the argument <code>true</code> indicates that the proxy
should be verified for trust, <i>constraints</i> is a
<code>MethodConstraints</code> object (an object containing the
per-method constraints to set on the proxy), and <i>permissions</i> is
an array containing the <code>java.security.Permission</code>s to be
granted to the proxy.

<p>The UML sequence diagrams (PDF files) referred to in the
next three sections illustrate the proxy preparation and trust
verification processes.  Together, these diagrams depict a full scenario
of verifying trust, granting permissions, and setting constraints:

<ul>

<li><a href="proxypreparation.pdf">Proxy Preparation (Figure 1)</a>:
illustrates verifying trust, granting permissions, and setting new
constraints on a proxy.

<li> <a href="simpleproxyverification.pdf">Non-Smart Proxy Trust
Verification (Figure 2)</a>: shows verifying trust of a non-smart proxy
(for example, a simple Jini ERI proxy) using a
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>. 

<li> <a href="smartproxyverification.pdf">Smart Proxy Trust
Verification (Figure 3)</a>: shows verifying trust of a smart proxy using a
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>. 

</ul>

<p>Note: See this tutorial for <a
href="http://www.togethersoft.com/services/practical_guides/umlonlinecourse/index.html#sequence-diagrams">a
description of the syntax of UML sequence diagrams</a>.

<p>Note that the <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> class is designed to be
subclassable, therefore the implementation of the
<code>prepareProxy</code> method invokes <code>protected</code>
methods on the instance (<code>verify</code>, <code>grant</code>,
<code>setConstraints</code>, etc.) to allow a potential subclass to
customize the instance behavior.

<h4>3.2.1 Verifying Trust</h4>


<p>The basic model for verifying trust in an object received from an
untrusted source is to consult one or more <i>trust verifiers</i> (of
type <code>net.jini.security.TrustVerifier</code>) that are
essentially part of the "trusted computing base" (a term which means
the platform's hardware and software that is fully trusted to enforce
the security mechanisms and policies in place) to see if at least one
of those verifiers trusts the object in question.  If one trust
verifier is unable to verify trust, then another one is consulted.
This trust verification process is carried out by the
<code>static</code> method <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code>.

<p>The <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code> method obtains trust
verifiers from a resource,
<code>META-INF/services/net.jini.security.TrustVerifier</code>, which,
in this distribution, is part of the file
<code>jsk-resources.jar</code>, which is referenced by
<code>jsk-platform.jar</code>.  These built-in trust verifiers are
provided to verify instances of classes in the Apache River release.  The
following table lists these trust verifier implementations along with
a description of the instances they verify:

<blockquote>
<table summary="Describes the standard TrustVerifier implementations"

     <td valign="top"> discovery constraints
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Most clients will use one or more of the trust verifiers above
(indirectly) when verifying trust in a proxy.  However, a service will
need to implement a special trust verifier for a smart proxy, or for a
proxy produced by <code>BasicJeriExporter</code>.

<p>Proxy preparation is initiated by invoking the
<code>prepareProxy</code> method on a <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code>
instance (constructed as above, with <i>verify</i> set to
<code>true</code>), passing it the <i>proxy</i> to be prepared (see <a
href="proxypreparation.pdf">Figure 1</a>).  The
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> instance initiates trust verification
by invoking the <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code> method,
passing the <i>proxy</i>, the value <code>null</code> (<i>loader</i>) to
specify the context class loader, and the <i>constraints</i> (obtained
from the instance itself) to use on any remote communication by the
trust verification mechanism.

<p>The <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code> method obtains the
trust verifiers from the resource in the specified <i>loader</i> (if
the trust verifiers have not already been obtained) and creates a
<code>net.jini.security.TrustVerifier.Context</code> (<i>context</i>)
containing the ordered list of trust verifiers.  Next, the
<code>isTrustedObject</code> method of each trust verifier is invoked,
passing it the proxy to be verified and the trust verifier context,
until one trust verifier returns <code>true</code>.  A given trust
verifier will return <code>true</code> if it can verify trust in the
object passed to it.  A trust verifier may also use the context passed
to verify other component objects recursively, before deciding
whether it trusts the object.

<p>The <code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code> method returns
<code>true</code> if there is at least one trust verifier in the
context that trusts the proxy.

<p>A <code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustVerifier</code>
can verify a service proxy for which a trusted verifier can be obtained
from the service's remote object in a pre-defined manner,
requiring cooperation with the proxy and the service's
remote object.  The two typical cases that
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> handles are: verifying non-smart
proxies (for example, a simple proxy returned by
<code>BasicJeriExporter</code>) and verifying smart proxies that
wrap simple (non-smart) proxies.  These cases are described in
the following two sections.

<p><code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> implements a trust verification
mechanism that uses a trusted <i>bootstrap proxy</i> (either
derived or obtained from the original proxy) to obtain a
trust verifier from the server to use to verify the
original proxy.

<p>The reasoning behind this trust verification approach is as
follows: if you trust the service (like your bank), and you
obtain the trust verifier by communicating with the service
through a trusted bootstrap proxy with server authentication and
integrity, then you can trust the verifier returned by the
service to verify the service proxy.  After all, it is the
service that knows best how to verify its own proxies.

<h4>Non-Smart Proxy Trust Verification</h4>

<p>If a non-smart proxy that is a dynamic proxy would be directly
trusted by a local trust verifier if only its proxy class were
defined by a class loader trusted by such a verifier, then the
non-smart proxy can implement
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrust</code> so that it
can be verified by a
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustVerifier</code>.  In
this case, the service's remote object must also cooperate
in <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>'s verification scheme by
providing a <code>TrustVerifier</code> for its proxies as
described in the section "Implementation Requirements for Trust
Verification".

<p>The mechanism implemented by <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>
verifies non-smart proxies by performing the following:

<ul>
<li> Creates a "derivative bootstrap proxy" from the proxy,
<li> Verifies trust in this derivative bootstrap proxy using the
     locally trusted verifiers, and then
<li> Uses the derivative bootstrap proxy to obtain, from the
     service, a trust verifier for the proxy itself.
</ul>

<p>The details of this mechanism are implemented by the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier.isTrustedObject</code> method (depicted in <a
href="simpleproxyverification.pdf">Figure 2</a>).

The proxy itself implements <code>ProxyTrust</code> and, as such,
is considered a bootstrap proxy.  However, this proxy is not
typically trusted because, in most cases, the proxy's class is
defined by an untrusted class loader when the proxy is received
by a remote virtual machine.  In this case if certain conditions
are met, the <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> creates a
"derivative bootstrap proxy" using a dynamic proxy class defined
by the parent class loader (which is typically a trusted class
loader) with the identical invocation handler as the bootstrap
proxy.  If the derivative bootstrap proxy is trusted by one of
the locally trusted trust verifiers available in the context
(determined by invoking <code>isTrustedObject</code> on the
<code>TrustVerifier.Context</code>), then the derivative
bootstrap proxy is the bootstrap proxy.

<p>If the derivative bootstrap proxy is trusted, then the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> can obtain the trust verifier
from the service.  The <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> first sets
constraints (obtained from the context) on the derivative
bootstrap proxy so that it will obtain the trust verifier from
the server in a secure way.  Next, the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> invokes the
<code>ProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method on the bootstrap
proxy to obtain the trust verifier.  This invocation is a remote
call to a "bootstrap remote object" that implements the
<code>ProxyTrust</code> interface.  The
<code>getProxyVerifier</code> implementation can then call the
 <code>ServerProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method on the
service (which is a local method call) to obtain the trust
verifier and then return the result.  Note that the bootstrap
remote object and the service remote object could be the same object; that is,
the service object can implement <code>ProxyTrust</code>.  
If the service's remote object is exported to use
<code>BasicInvocationDispatcher</code>, a separate bootstrap
remote object is not needed, nor does the remote object's class
need to implement <code>ProxyTrust</code>, because
<code>BasicInvocationDispatcher</code> takes care of these details.
In this case, however, the service's remote object will still
need to implement <code>ServerProxyTrust</code> as described in
the section  <a href="#serverProxyTrust">"Implementing
<code>ServerProxyTrust</code>"</a>.

<p>After the <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> obtains the trust
verifier from the service, it can then invoke the trust verifier's
<code>isTrustedObject</code> method, passing it the original service proxy and
the context, to determine whether the proxy is really a proxy that the
service trusts.

<h4>Smart Proxy Trust Verification</h4>

<p>Smart proxies or other proxies that do not implement
<code>ProxyTrust</code> and that cannot be verified directly by the
built-in trust verifiers can also be verified by
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustVerifier</code>.  A
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>, in verifying smart proxies, uses
some mechanisms in addition to those described above for
non-smart proxies that implement <code>ProxyTrust</code>
directly.  As with non-smart proxies verified by
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>, a smart proxy and its corresponding
remote object must cooperate in
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>'s verification mechanism.  The
implementation requirements for service proxies and their remote objects
are described in the section "Implementation
Requirements for Trust Verification".

<p>The mechanism implemented by <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>
verifies smart proxies by performing the following:

<ul>
<li> Obtains a "bootstrap proxy" from the proxy,
<li> Verifies trust in the bootstrap proxy using the locally trusted
     verifiers, and then
<li> Uses the bootstrap proxy to obtain, from the service, a trust
     verifier for the proxy itself.
</ul>

<p>The details of this mechanism are implemented by the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier.isTrustedObject</code> method (depicted in <a
href="smartproxyverification.pdf">Figure 3</a>).  The
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> uses a special iterator,
<code>ProxyTrustIterator</code>, to obtain the bootstrap proxy.  This
special iterator and the bootstrap proxy (from the iterator) are
obtained as follows.

<p>The <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> reflectively invokes a
(typically private) method, <code>getProxyTrustIterator</code>, on the
supplied proxy or the supplied proxy's invocation handler to obtain a
<code>ProxyTrustIterator</code>.  This iterator is used to obtain the
bootstrap proxy, an object that must implement the interface
<code>ProxyTrust</code>, which is a remote interface for obtaining a
proxy trust verifier from the service.  If the object returned from
the iterator is not a <code>ProxyTrust</code> instance, then a
<code>ProxyTrustIterator</code> is obtained from the returned object
recursively.  Otherwise, if the returned object does not implement the
interface <code>RemoteMethodControl</code>, the
<code>ProxyTrustIterator</code> is used again to obtain another
candidate bootstrap proxy.

<p>When the iterator returns a bootstrap proxy implementing
<code>ProxyTrust</code> and <code>RemoteMethodControl</code>,
the <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>
verifies trust in the bootstrap proxy by using the locally trusted
trust verifiers available in the context.  This trust verification
process is the same as described for the method
<code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code>.

<p>If the bootstrap proxy is not trusted by the locally trusted
verifiers available in the context (that is, the method
<code>isTrustedObject</code> on the
<code>TrustVerifier.Context</code> returns <code>false</code>),
then if certain conditions are met, the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> creates a "derivative bootstrap
proxy" using a dynamic proxy class defined by the parent class
loader (which is typically a trusted class loader) with the
identical invocation handler as the bootstrap proxy.  If the
derivative bootstrap proxy is trusted by one of the locally
trusted verifiers (determined by invoking
<code>isTrustedObject</code> on the
<code>TrustVerifier.Context</code>), then the derivative
bootstrap proxy can be used as the bootstrap proxy.

<p>Once trust in the bootstrap proxy (or derivative) has been established, the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> can obtain the trust verifier from the
service.  The <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> first sets constraints
(obtained from the context) on the bootstrap proxy so that it will
obtain the trust verifier from the server in a secure way.  Next, the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> invokes the
<code>ProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method on the bootstrap proxy
to obtain the trust verifier.  This invocation is a remote call to a
"bootstrap remote object" that implements the <code>ProxyTrust</code>
interface.  The <code>getProxyVerifier</code> implementation can then
call the
 <code>ServerProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method on the service
(which is a local method call) to obtain the trust verifier and then
return the result.  Note that the bootstrap remote object and the
service's remote object could be the same object; that is, the service object can
implement <code>ProxyTrust</code>.

<p>After the <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> obtains the trust
verifier from the service, it can then invoke the trust verifier's
<code>isTrustedObject</code> method, passing it the service proxy and
the context, to determine whether the proxy is really a proxy that the
service trusts.

<h4>Implementation Requirements for Proxy Trust Verification</h4>

<p>There are two main kinds of service proxies: a "simple" proxy,
that is, a "non-smart" proxy returned from export (like a JRMP
stub), and a smart proxy that wraps the proxy returned from
export.  This section describes the verifiers that can be used to
verify different categories of proxies, based on their
characteristics, and explains the implementation requirements
for service proxies and their respective remote objects.

<p>A <code>BasicJeriTrustVerifier</code> can be used as a trust
verifier for a Jini ERI proxy (a proxy returned by
<code>BasicJeriExporter</code>) if that proxy's class is defined by a
trusted class loader and uses <code>BasicInvocationHandler</code>
and <code>BasicObjectEndpoint</code> containing locally
verifiable endpoint instances (such as
<code>net.jini.jeri.ssl.HttpsEndpoint</code> and
<code>net.jini.jeri.kerberos.KerberosEndpoint</code>).  This is
not a typical case, though, because in most cases, the class of a
Jini ERI proxy received by a remote VM will be defined by an
untrusted class loader.

<p>If a Jini ERI proxy satisfies all of
<code>BasicJeriTrustVerifier</code>'s conditions for trust, except
the condition regarding its dynamic proxy class's loader, then
(on the asumption that the parent of that loader will be locally
trusted) the service proxy and its remote object can cooperate
in the verification mechanism provided by
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code>.  In this case, the proxy itself
serves as the bootstrap proxy and must implement
<code>ProxyTrust</code>.  To facilitate this, the service's
remote object can be exported with a
<code>net.jini.jeri.ProxyTrustILFactory</code> which ensures that
the service proxy implements <code>ProxyTrust</code> (in addition
to <code>RemoteMethodControl</code>).  The service's remote object
must also implement the
<code>ServerProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method to return a
verifier for the proxy (as described below in the section <a
href="#serverProxyTrust">"Implementing
<code>ServerProxyTrust</code>"</a>).

<p>If a Jini ERI proxy that could be trusted by clients (perhaps
by <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> as described above) is used
inside a smart proxy that will not be trusted directly by
clients, a <code>ProxyTrustILFactory</code> can be used to cause
the inner Jini ERI proxy to also be an instance of
<code>ProxyTrust</code> (in addition to
<code>RemoteMethodControl</code>).  To fit into the
<code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> mechanism, the outer proxy must
implement the <code>getProxyTrustIterator</code> method to return
a <code>ProxyTrustIterator</code> whose <code>next</code> method
returns the inner proxy (referred to as the "bootstrap proxy"
above).  The
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.SingletonProxyTrustIterator</code>
is a simple implementation of <code>ProxyTrustIterator</code>
whose <code>next</code> method returns the object the instance is
constructed with.  Additionally, the service's remote object must
implement the <code>ServerProxyTrust</code> interface to return a
trust verifier that verifies the proxy (as described below in the
section <a href="#serverProxyTrust">"Implementing
<code>ServerProxyTrust</code>"</a>).

<p>For other smart proxies or Jini ERI proxies containing a custom
invocation handler or custom endpoint that will not be trusted
directly by clients, a
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustExporter</code> can be
used to combine that proxy with a trustable bootstrap proxy, such that
the client can use <code>ProxyTrustVerifier</code> to verify that the
aggregate proxy can be trusted.  The service's remote object would
need to implement <code>ServerProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code>
to return a verifier for the aggregate proxy.


<h5><a name="serverProxyTrust"></a>Implementing <code>ServerProxyTrust</code></h5>

<p>A service's remote object should implement
the <code>ServerProxyTrust</code> interface
to provide a trust verifier for its proxies that simply
compares a known canonical service proxy with the yet-to-be-trusted proxy,
testing that the proxies are <i>trust equivalent</i>.  An object is
considered trust equivalent to a known, trusted object if it is
equivalent in trust, content, and function to that trusted object.  The
<code>net.jini.security.proxytrust.TrustEquivalence</code> interface
can be implemented by trusted objects (say component objects in the
proxy) that need to allow other objects to be checked for trust
equivalence.   The <code>TrustEquivalence</code> interface has a
single method, <code>checkTrustEquivalence</code>, for checking trust
equivalence. 

<p>An implementation of a basic proxy trust verifier, which could be
returned by an implementation of the
<code>ServerProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier</code> method, is the <a
href="api/org/apache/river/proxy/BasicProxyTrustVerifier.html"><code>org.apache.river.proxy.BasicProxyTrustVerifier</code></a>
(see the source code <a
href="../source/src/org/apache/river/proxy/BasicProxyTrustVerifier.java"><code>BasicProxyTrustVerifier.java</code></a>
for implementation details).


<h4>3.2.2 Granting Permissions</h4>

<p>Once trust in a proxy has been verified, the client may wish to
grant permissions to the proxy so that future invocations on the proxy
will function correctly.  This task can also be accomplished through a
<code>BasicProxyPreparer</code>.

<p>Permissions can only be granted to a proxy if dynamic
permission grants are supported by the installed security policy
implementation.  This release provides a
<code>java.security.Policy</code> implementation,
<code>net.jini.security.policy.DynamicPolicyProvider</code>, that
supports such dynamic granting of permissions at runtime. The
<code>DynamicPolicyProvider</code> implements the interface
<code>net.jini.security.policy.DynamicPolicy</code>, which defines
methods for granting permissions on the granularity of a class loader.
For an application to grant a specific permission, the calling context
must have <code>net.jini.security.GrantPermission</code> for the
permission being granted.  Note that the <code>Security</code> class
has a <code>static</code> method, <code>grantSupported</code>, that
can be called to check whether dynamic permission grants are
supported.

<p>A <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> grants permissions to the proxy
on the granularity of the proxy's class loader.  The preparer invokes
its own <code>getPermissions</code> method, passing the
proxy, to obtain the permissions to grant.  If there are permissions
to grant, the preparer invokes <code>Security.grant</code> with the
proxy's class (<i>proxyClass</i>) and the <i>permissions</i> to grant
(see Figure 1).

<p>The <code>Security.grant</code> operation will delegate to the
security policy implementation to grant the permissions if the policy
supports dynamic permission grants via <code>DynamicPolicy</code>.
This <code>Security.grant</code> method grants the specified
permissions to all protection domains that are associated with the
class loader of the given class (which, in this example, is the
proxy's class) and passes at least the principals of the current
subject (if any).  If grants are not supported or the calling context
does not have the requisite <code>GrantPermission</code> for each
permission to grant, then a <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown.

<h4>3.2.3 Setting Constraints</h4>

<p>Once trust is verified and permissions (if any) have been granted
to the proxy, constraints should be set on the proxy to ensure the
desired level of security on future remote invocations through the
proxy.  A <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code>'s final task is to set
constraints (if any) on the proxy, resulting in a new proxy (with the
constraints set), and to return that proxy as the result of the
<code>prepareProxy</code> operation (see Figure 1).

<p>A proxy must implement the interface
<code>net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl</code> to enable
the setting of constraints.  Constraints are set by invoking the
proxy's <code>setConstraints</code> method, passing a
<code>MethodConstraints</code> object containing the constraints to
set.  A <code>BasicProxyPreparer</code> obtains the method constraints
from itself by invoking its own <code>getMethodConstraints</code>
method and then sets these constraints on the proxy.  The 
copy of the proxy (<i>new proxy</i>) returned by the
<code>setConstraints</code> method is returned as the result of
preparing the proxy.

<h3>3.3 Code Integrity</h3>

The <code>net.jini.core.constraint.Integrity</code> constraint should
be set on a proxy if remote calls through that proxy require integrity
protection on both the in-band call data, transmitted as part of the
remote call, and the code downloaded out-of-band as a result of the
call.  A communication mechanism enforcing an <code>Integrity</code>
constraint can use the <code>Security.verifyCodebaseIntegrity</code>
method to determine if all URLs in a codebase provide content
integrity, based on whatever
<code>net.jini.security.IntegrityVerifier</code> instances are
configured.

<p>The application does not have to worry about verifying codebase
integrity itself; that task is carried out by the underlying
communication mechanism enforcing the <code>Integrity</code>
constraint.  Such communication mechanisms should verify the
codebase URLs for integrity when unmarshalling objects during a remote
call. 

<p>The <code>Security.verifyCodebaseIntegrity</code> method obtains
integrity verifiers from a resource,
<code>META-INF/services/net.jini.security.IntegrityVerifier</code>,
which, in this distribution (and similar to trust verifiers),
is part of the file <code>jsk-resources.jar</code>.  The following
table lists the standard integrity verifier implementations along
with the type of URLs they verify. <p>

<blockquote>
<table summary="Describes the standard IntegrityVerifier implementations"
       border=1 cellpadding=5>
<th> <code>IntegrityVerifier</code> <th> Verified URLs
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.url.httpmd.HttpmdIntegrityVerifier</code>
     <td> HTTPMD
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.url.https.HttpsIntegrityVerifier</code>
     <td> HTTPS
<tr> <td> <code>net.jini.url.file.FileIntegrityVerifier</code>
     <td> FILE
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism implemented by
<code>Security.verifyCodebaseIntegrity</code> is pluggable (since it
uses a resource), so that other <code>IntegrityVerifier</code>
implementations can be configured if a deployment requires other URL
types to have their integrity protection verified.

<h4>HTTPMD URLs</h4>

<p>A deployment requiring integrity protection for downloaded code may
wish to make use of HTTPMD URLs, introduced in this release.  An
HTTPMD URL includes a message digest for the data retrieved from the
URL.  The URL input stream ensures that the data has the correct
message digest when the end of file for the stream is reached.

<p>The reasoning behind why HTTPMD URLs can be used to verify code
integrity is as follows.  An HTTPMD URL (configured in a codebase path
for an application and subsequently used by the underlying
communication mechanism as a class annotation) is transmitted in band
as part of a remote call.  Because the HTTPMD URL (both the URL and
message digest component) is transmitted in band, the message digest
can be trusted to the same extent as any other data transmitted in the
call.  If the HTTPMD URL is communicated with integrity, the value of
the message digest must be correct.  Therefore, the URL input stream
can use the message digest to verify correctly the integrity of the
stream contents.

<p>The URL protocol handlers in J2SE can be configured with additional
protocol handlers, over and above built-in handlers (such as for HTTP
and FILE URLs).  To configure the use of HTTPMD URLs for an
application, the "java.protocol.handler.pkgs" system property should
be set to "net.jini.url".

<p>For convenience, the tool <a
href="api/org/apache/river/tool/ComputeHttpmdCodebase.html"><code>ComputeHttpmdCodebase</code></a>
can be used to compute message digests for a codebase with HTTPMD
URLs.


<h2>4 Jini Extensible Remote Invocation </h2>

<p>Jini ERI, defined in the <a href="api/net/jini/jeri/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.jeri</code> package</a>, is a
pluggable implementation of the Java RMI programming model that
supports the remote object export model defined in the
<a href="api/net/jini/export/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.export</code> package</a> and supports the security model
described above, including invocation constraints, remote method
control, and the trust verification model.  Jini ERI allows
customization of client-side and server-side remote invocation
behavior and also allows the use of a variety of communication
transports.

<p>See the <a
href="api/net/jini/jeri/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.jeri</code> package
documentation</a> for more information.

<h2>5 Service Providers</h2>

<p>While this release provides a pluggable infrastructure with many
avenues for customization, it also includes many provider
implementations that are sufficient for most applications.  These
providers are summarized in this section.

<p>Many applications will use the supplied providers, having one or
more of them specified in deployment-time information in a
resource or configuration.  Other applications may implement one or more
of their own providers if their application deployment requires a
more specific feature that is not implemented by the built-in
providers.

<p>In general, an application developer or deployer does not need to
understand all APIs used by providers.  Such APIs only need to be
well-understood if one is developing a new service provider or
customizing some aspect of an existing one.

<h3>5.1 Providers located by resources</h3>

<p>The following is a list of provider interfaces and associated
implementations that are located via resources (and specified in
<code>jsk-resources.jar</code>).  For the most part, these
provider interfaces and implementations are used by other
infrastructure implementations.  Applications generally don't
need to program to either the interfaces or the implementations
of these kinds of providers with some minor exceptions: to
implement <code>TrustVerifier</code> for a smart/custom proxy,
and to reference a <code>Configuration</code>.

<h3>5.2 Providers specified in configurations</h3>

<p>The providers in this section are those that a deployer may specify
explicitly in a configuration.  Applications typically program to the
interfaces of these providers, but not their implementations.  Many
applications can utilize the implementations available in the 
Apache River release, and therefore, don't need to worry about how to implement a
specific interface, only how to use it.
