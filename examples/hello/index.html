<h1>Hello Example</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Hello example was created to illustrate how a typical Jini 
technology-based application can be configured and optionally secured
using the configuration and Jini extensible remote invocation (Jini ERI) 
facilities that arrived in version 2.0 of the Jini Technology Starter Kit 
. The components built from the files making up this example 
are a <i>server</i> component that implements a <code>Hello</code> 
interface with a <code>sayHello()</code> method, and a <i>client</i> 
component that employs a <i>lookup service</i> to obtain a reference to 
the server through which the client invokes the <code>sayHello()</code> 
method. 
<p>
One of the primary purposes of this example is to demonstrate how an 
application can be written in such a way that it needs to be built 
only once, but can be run to use various communication protocols and 
security policies by merely deploying under different configurations
<i>without having to change a single line of Java(TM) programming 
language source code</i>! Thus, although there is only a single example 
presented in this document, there are a number of scenarios under 
which this example can be run. The first part of this document 
provides instructions for <a href="#quick-start">getting started quickly</a>, 
and the second part provides <a href="#deeper">more detailed descriptions</a>
of each scenario. 
<p>
The combinations of ways in which the components of this simple 
example can be configured are derived from options like the following:

<ul>
  <li>Secure or non-secure?</li>
  <li>Activatable or non-activatable?</li>
  <li>If non-secure then using JRMP or Jini ERI?</li>
  <li>If secure then secured through an SSL provider or a Kerberos provider?</li>
  <li>If non-secure and activatable then using a JRMP-configured Phoenix or
      using a Jini ERI-configured Phoenix?</li>
  <li>Does it use a customized invocation handler?</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

When run under any of the configurations provided in this example, 
the application simply says, "Hello, world!". 
<p>
This example also demonstrates the use of the 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/config/Configuration.html"><code>Configuration</code></a>,
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/export/Exporter.html"><code>Exporter</code></a>,
and 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/ProxyPreparer.html"><code>ProxyPreparer</code></a>
interfaces to configure the client, server, lookup service, and 
activation system 
(<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html"><i>Phoenix</i></a>) 
for the desired remote communication and security. Additionally, 
references to the source files for the application as well as the 
various configuration and policy files that can be used to run the 
application in different ways are also presented.
<p>
To aid in working with the example, this page is divided into the
following sections:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#setup">Setup</a></li>
  <li><a href="#quick-start">Quick Start</a></li>
  <li><a href="#changes">Making Changes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></li>
  <li><a href="#deeper">Looking Deeper</a></li>
</ul>

Although running the example under the secure configurations requires 
a little bit of one-time <a href="#setup">setup</a>, you should be able 
to run each of the non-secure configurations "out of the box", with
no setup at all. For those who wish to jump right in, the 
<a href="#quick-start">quick start</a> section presents the basic 
steps necessary to run the example under each of the possible 
configurations without a lot of additional explanation. That section
also contains a convenient <a href="#config-table">table</a> that 
presents the various scripts one can use to run the example. In that 
table, the scripts are organized in a fashion that is intended to
make it obvious which scripts should be executed for a particular
configuration.
<p>
If, after acquiring some experience with running the example, you would 
like to experiment with modifying the example's source code, the section 
on <a href="#changes">making changes</a></li> presents a set of steps 
that can be followed to rebuild the example to include those changes.
Should problems be encountered while running the example, a small of 
set of <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting tips</a> are presented 
that may be helpful in diagnosing and solving some of the more common 
problems.
Finally, for those who desire a deeper understanding and are looking 
for a starting point for designing and configuring applications, the 
contents of the source code, configuration files, and policy files 
employed in this example can be explored by accessing the references 
contained in the section that takes a <a href="#deeper">deeper look</a>.

<a name="setup">
<h2>Setup (Secure Configurations Only)</h2>
</a>

To run this example under the secure configurations that are provided, 
one can choose to use either the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#SSLOverview">Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (SSL)</a>
as provided by the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html">Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)</a>,
or the Kerberos provider through the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jgss/tutorials">Java GSS-API</a>.
Additionally, when run under any of the secure configurations, this 
example exploits the 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/policy/DynamicPolicyProvider.html">dynamic permission granting</a>
features of the 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/policy/package-summary.html">security policy provider</a>
included in the Apache River release. 

<h4>SSL setup</h4>

No setup is necessary to run this example when configured to use 
SSL through JSSE. This is because the example comes with a set of 
pre-generated private keystores with associated passwords and
self-signed public key certificates (<i>certificates</i>), as 
well as a public keystore (<i>truststore</i>) that contains the 
certificate from each of the private keystores. Whereas each 
keystore is intended to represent private information associated 
with a particular component of the example, the truststore file 
that aggregates all of the public key certificates is treated as 
public information, shared by each component. Using this 
pre-generated data, the various SSL configurations can be run 
out of the box, with no setup required.
<p>
Please note that the keystores, truststore, and associated 
certificates are provided only for convenience. Using those 
items in anything but an example environment could pose a 
security risk because all parties who obtain this example have 
access to the same information; in particular, the same set of 
pre-generated private keys and passwords. To address any concerns 
one might have regarding this situation, the pre-generated 
keystores, password files, and truststore can be replaced with 
new versions in which the old private keys and passwords are 
replaced with different values that you supply, and the 
associated certificates are replaced with new certificates that 
are either self-signed or are signed by a valid certificate 
authority (<i>CA</i>). To generate your own private keys, as well 
as to create your own self-signed certificates, you can use the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CreateKeystore">keytool</a>
provided in the JDK(TM) software.

<h4>Kerberos setup</h4>

Unlike the SSL configurations that are provided, some setup must be 
performed to run this example under the configurations that use 
Kerberos through the Java GSS-API.
<p>
A Kerberos environment typically includes not only the clients
and servers wishing to securely communicate with each other, but 
also an authentication server referred to as a <i>Key Distribution Center</i>,
or <i>KDC</i>. The KDC runs on a <i>KDC host</i> and belongs to a 
<i>realm</i>. Each client and server - referred to as <i>Kerberos servers</i> 
for the purposes of this discussion - is associated with a 
Kerberos principal name as well as a 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/javax/security/auth/kerberos/KerberosKey.html">key</a>.
Using its principal name, each Keberos server retrieves its
associated key from a <i>keytab</i> file and uses that key to request
the services of the authentication server running on the KDC host.
This example assumes that either a new or pre-existing authentication
server, with the appropriate principal names, is operational in
the environment in which the example runs.
<p>
In addition to an authentication server, the following steps must
be taken to set up this example to run under the configurations that
use Kerberos:

<ul>
  <li>In the example's <code>config</code> directory, create a 
      keytab file named <code>krb-servers.keytab</code> that 
      contains the keys associated with each principal name 
      registered in the authentication server for this example. 
  </li>
  <li>In the example's <code>scripts</code> directory, edit the file 
      </code>krb-setenv.sh</code> (or </code>krb-setenv.bat</code>
      if on Windows). Set the realm name, the KDC host name, and each 
      principal name to the appropriate values. (Note that if any 
      of the environment variables being set in the script have 
      already been defined in the environment, the current values
      of those variables override the values being specified in the
      script.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

<h4>Installing the security policy provider for dynamic permission granting</h4>

In order to enable 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/policy/DynamicPolicyProvider.html">dynamic permission granting</a>,
the 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/policy/package-summary.html">security policy provider</a>
included in the Apache River release must be installed as an extension 
in the Java 2 SDK (or JRE) used to run this example. Although the
<a href="../../doc/info-index.html#install">top level documentation</a>
of the Apache River release discusses two different strategies for installing 
the policy provider, the strategy that this example <b>requires</b> 
is the strategy in which the JAR file <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> 
is copied into the Java extensions directory; specifically:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Locate the <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> file in the
      <code>lib-ext</code> directory of the Apache River release.
  </li>
  <li>Locate the <code>jre/lib/ext</code> directory inside your
      Java 2 SDK (or JRE) distribution.
  </li>
  <li>Copy the <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> file from the Apache River release
      to the <code>jre/lib/ext</code> directory as located in step 2.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
After following the steps outlined above, if the virtual machine 
for the Java platform associated with the <code>ext</code> directory 
is available in your path, then the features provided by the security 
policy provider included in the Apache River release will be available when 
running the example.
<p>
<hr>

<a name="quick-start">
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
</a>
This example can be run on a single machine or distributed among
multiple machines. The client, server, and lookup service can each
be run on separate machines if desired, but the activatable form 
of the server and the activation system 
(<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html">Phoenix</a>)
must run on the
same machine. Note also that when the example is distributed among
multiple machines, a class server must be run on each machine 
in the system. For simplicity, the instructions below will
assume the example is run in separate command windows 
<i>on a single machine</i>.
<p>
To start, open five command windows, one for each of the following:

<ol type=a start=1>
  <li>httpd</li>
  <li>phoenix</li>
  <li>lookup service</li>
  <li>server</li>
  <li>client</li>
</ol>

That is, the instructions below assume the class server will be
run in window a., Phoenix in window b., the lookup service in 
window c., etc. Note also that the instructions assume the operating
system is UNIX, Linux, or OS X. If running on Windows, simply
replace the file separator '/' with '\', and either remove the
UNIX shell script suffix '.sh', or replace it with the Windows
command file suffix '.bat'. For example, based on the instructions
below, to start the lookup service using JRMP on UNIX, Linux, 
or OS X, one would type the following at the prompt ('<code>>></code>') 
in the c. window,

<pre>
  c. >> scripts/jrmp-reggie.sh
</pre>

whereas on Windows, one would type one of the following:

<pre>
  c. >> scripts\jrmp-reggie
  c. >> scripts\jrmp-reggie.bat
</pre>

Upon opening the five command windows described above, in each
window, change the directory to the hello directory. That is,

<pre>
  a. >> cd <<code>riverDir</code>>/examples/hello
  b. >> cd <<code>riverDir</code>>/examples/hello
  c. >> cd <<code>riverDir</code>>/examples/hello
  d. >> cd <<code>riverDir</code>>/examples/hello
  e. >> cd <<code>riverDir</code>>/examples/hello
</pre>

<h3>Running the class server</h3>

To run this example under any of the possible configurations, a single 
class server should be started to serve up files from both the example's
<code>lib</code> directory and the Apache River release <code>lib-dl</code>
directory. The 
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/tool/ClassServer.html">class server</a>
provided in the Apache River release is used for this purpose. Note that once 
started, there is no need to shut down the class server (cntrl-c) until 
it is no longer needed. This is because that single class server can be 
shared by each configuration. To start the class server, type the 
following in the a. command window:

<pre>
  a. >> <code><a href="scripts/httpd.sh">scripts/httpd.sh</a></code>
</pre>

<h3>Running the configurations</h3>

This example presents eleven different configurations that can be run. 

The primary characteristic that distinguishes one configuration
from another is the protocol used for communication by the example's
server application; that is, 

<ol type=A start=1>
  <li>JRMP</li>
  <li>Jini ERI (JERI)</li>
  <li>SSL (JSSE)</li>
  <li>Kerberos (GSS)</li>
</ol>

In some cases, the protocols can be mixed. For example, in each of the 
non-secure configurations, the lookup service uses only JRMP for its 
remote communication, even when the server and the client use Jini ERI. 
For the secure configurations, all parties must use the same 
communication protocol; that is, SSL or Kerberos.
<p>
For each primary characteristic, there are secondary characteristics 
associated with a particular configuration that further distinguishes 
one configuration from the others. As with the primary characteristic, 
the secondary characteristics are generally related to behavior 
demonstrated by the example's server. For example, is the server 
activatable or non-activatable? Are remote calls confirmed or not?
<p>
The quick start instructions in the table below are organized and 
presented based on these primary and secondary characteristics.
Each row represents one of the configurations under which the
example may be run. The column labelled <b><i>Execution</i></b> 
presents the scripts that must be executed to run the example 
under that particular configuration. The column labelled
<b><i>Upon Completion</i></b> presents what must be done to 
"clean up" and prepare for executing another configuration. The
indicated letters refer to the window in which the associated
script or command should be executed.
<p>
Note that with respect to the username that must be provided in
the Kerberos configurations, as well as the password that is
required by both the Kerberos and the SSL configurations, the 
values shown in the table do not necessarily represent the 
actual values that must be input by the user. The password that
the table shows for the SSL configurations is the same as the 
password used when generating the private keystore supplied 
with this example for the client component. Thus, as long as 
the client's keystore is not replaced with a new keystore with 
a different password, the password shown below can be used as 
shown.
<p>
With respect to the Kerberos configurations, the actual values 
to input for the username and password, are the Kerberos principal 
name and corresponding password that are registered with the 
particular Kerberos authentication server (KDC) that will be 
used when running the example; and which are associated with 
the client component through the krb-setenv.sh script 
(or krb-setenv.bat command file).

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
</a>

While running the example, you may encounter problems. This
section attempts to describe some of the more common problems
and their possible causes and solutions. Please note that
the information contained in this section is by no means 
complete or exhaustive.

<h4>Class server not started or improperly configured</h4>

If you encounter output containing information like the
following, you should verify that you have started a
class server listening on the correct port and serving
classes from the correct directories.

<pre>
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarProxy
                                  (could not obtain preferred value)
</pre>

<h4>Dynamic permission grants not supported</h4>

If you encounter a stack trace that contains information like that
shown below, the problem is usually related to the security policy 
provider for dynamic permission granting.

<pre>
java.lang.SecurityException: Dynamic permission grants are not supported
....
Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: grants not supported
</pre>

The cause of the above problem is typically an incorrectly installed 
(or not installed at all) <code>jsk-policy.jar</code> file. Another 
(only slightly) less common cause is a 'typo' in the system property 
<code>java.security.properties</code> referenced on the command line.
For example,

<pre>-Djava.security.properties=config/dynamic-policy.security-properties</pre>

If the file referenced in the property above does not exist or is 
unreachable, or if there is a typo in either the property name or 
the file name, an exception trace like that above will occur.

<h4>No trusted certificates found</h4>

<pre>
INFO: exception while preparing lookup service proxy
java.rmi.ConnectIOException: I/O exception connecting to BasicObjectEndpoint[...]; 
        nested exception is:  net.jini.io.UnsupportedConstraintException:
        sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: No trusted certificate found
</pre>

This problem occurs when running the SSL configurations and is
typically encountered when one or more public key certificates
cannot be found. A common cause of this problem is an incorrect
<code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> system property. For example,

<pre>-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=prebuiltkeys/truststore</pre>

Although a missing or inaccessible file can cause this problem,
one of the most common mistakes made regarding this property
is to not capitalize the second '<code>S</code>' in the 
'<code>trustStore</code>' component of 
<code>javax.net.ssl.trust<b>S</b>tore</code>.

<h4>Mixing protocols</h4>

Although protocols can be mixed when using JRMP and Jini ERI,
protocols usually cannot be mixed when using the secure protocols. 
Depending on which party is running securely and which is not, 
different exception conditions will be encountered. For example, 
if the lookup service is run under a secure configuration, and 
the client or server is run under one of the basic configurations, 
output like the following may be encountered:

<pre>java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: httpmd</pre>

On the other hand, if the lookup service is run under one of the 
basic configurations, but the client or server is run under a 
secure configuration, the output will probably contain information 
like the following:

<pre>
INFO: exception while preparing lookup service proxy
java.lang.SecurityException: object is not trusted: com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarProxy[...]
        at net.jini.security.Security.verifyObjectTrust(Security.java:<<code>lineNo</code>>)
</pre>

<h4>Unsynchronized clocks</h4>

When running the example under one of the Kerberos configurations,
an exception indicating something like the following may be
encountered:

<pre>
Pre-authentication information was invalid (24) - Preauthentication failed. 
</pre>

Often this is an indication of skew between the clock on the
KDC host (running the authentication server) and the clock on
the host running the Kerberos server wishing to authenticate.
Those clocks should be set to the same time zones and 
synchronized to be within 5 minutes of each other.
<p>

<a name="deeper">
<h2>Looking Deeper</h2>
</a>

Once again, although only one example is being presented, that 
single example can be run under a variety of configurations to 
behave in ways that satisfy different requirements; requirements 
such as,

<ul>
  <li>How remote communication is performed</li>
  <li>Whether and how remote communication is controlled</li>
  <li>Whether and how access in the system is controlled</li>
  <li>Whether and how authentication is performed</li>
</ul>

This section goes a bit beyond what was presented in the 
<a href="#quick-start">quick start</a> section by diving a little
deeper, analyzing the purpose and contents of the various files 
provided with this example; source, configuration and policy files, 
manifests, preferred lists, etc.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The example presented here consists of distributed components 
that are federated by a Jini technology infrastructure to interact 
in a service-oriented manner. One of the components making up the
example is a Jini technology lookup service, through which the
example's client and service components are federated. Note
that for the purposes of this discussion, the term <b><i>service</i></b>
and the term <b><i>server</i></b> will often be used interchangably, 
with server referring to the actual incarnation of the service.
<p>
Recall that a common way to view a service is as a <i>provider</i>
of some sort of resource. A <i>client</i> of a service can
then be viewed as a <i>user</i> (or consumer) of the resource
provided by the service. For example, consider the Jini technology
lookup service itself. The lookup service provides multiple
resources that can be useful to both clients and other services. 
One resource provided by the lookup service is "residency" in
the lookup service. Through the residency a lookup service 
provides to another service, that other service advertises the 
availability of its own resource(s). Another resource provided by 
the lookup service is a "query resource". Clients can query the
lookup service for, and obtain references to, other services 
having resources the client wishes to use.
<p>
For each and every configuration in this example, the service 
component of the example discovers the lookup service and then 
requests and is granted residency in the lookup service.
The client also discovers the lookup service, but rather than
requesting residency, the client queries the lookup service
for a service of type <code>Hello</code>, and the lookup service
provides the client with a reference (a <i>proxy</i>) to that 
service. Once the client has obtained a proxy to the service 
of interest, through that proxy, the client <i>uses</i> the 
service to display a greeting, which is the resource the service 
provides. To see the implementation details, examine the contents 
of the following source files. Note that it is the proxy object 
that implements the <code>Hello</code> interface, which is the 
service type the client requests from the lookup service.

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Hello.java">Hello.java</a></code> - the interface which represents the service type</li>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Server.java">Server.java</a></code> - the server component that exports the remote object</li>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Proxy.java">Proxy.java</a></code> - the proxy object obtained by the client from the lookup service</li>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Client.java">Client.java</a></code> - the client component</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding the configurations</h3>

To understand the differences in the various configurations 
under which this example can be run, it's important to first 
recognize that interactions between the components in the 
federation occur primarily through remote invocations. Recall 
that when a remote invocation is made from one component to 
another, the call is <i>initiated</i> in the first component's 
virtual machine (VM), then communication occurs from one VM to the 
other, with the call ultimately executing in the second component's 
VM. In particular, when a service requests residency in the 
lookup service, when a client queries the lookup service for 
a service of interest, and when a client uses (the remote
methods of) that service (for example, to display the greeting 
in this example), remote calls are made. Because communication 
is occurring between remote, possibly untrusted, parties, the 
ability to configure and control how that communication occurs 
can be important.
<p>
The point of this example is to show how the source can be 
written and built only once, yet executed using different 
(possibly mixed) remote communication mechanisms with different 
controls and constraints placed on how that communication occurs; 
by merely running under different configurations that are 
specified at runtime. No matter what configuration is used to 
run the example, the client's goal is always the same: to use 
a lookup service to find a <code>Hello</code> service, and 
then to use the <code>Hello</code> service to display a greeting. 
As will be further explained in the sub-sections below, the 
differences in the configurations lie in how the remote calls 
between the components are implemented and controlled.
<p>

<i>
<b>Tip:</b>
   with respect to the emphasis on remote communication between
   the components of the system, if the example is being run on a
   single machine, it might help to view the separate windows as 
   separate machines on which each component runs and communicates 
   with the others.
</i>

<h3>Basic configurations</h3>

Consider the configurations A-1, B-2, B-4, and B-5 as presented 
in the <a href="#config-table">quick start table</a>. For the 
purposes of this discussion, those configurations will be 
referred to as the <i>basic</i> configurations because no 
access control (either manual or provided through the protocol) 
and no authentication occurs when two components in the system 
attempt to communicate with each other. These configurations 
demonstrate the basic operation of the example, highlighting the 
ability of the JRMP and Jini ERI protocols to coexist in a system. 
With any of these configurations, one should simply see the 
"Hello, world!" greeting displayed in the command window from 
which the client was run.
<p>
<h4>Configuration files</h4>

Because this example emphasizes the concept of 
"one source, different configurations", it may be helpful to examine 
and compare the contents of the basic configuration files that are
provided.
<p>

<b><i>Basic configuration files</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/jrmp-reggie.config">config/jrmp-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/jrmp-server.config">config/jrmp-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/jeri-server.config">config/jeri-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/client.config">config/client.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>

Recall that remote objects must be 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/export/package-summary.html"><i>exported</i></a>.
The process of 
exporting a remote object results in the creation of a <i>proxy</i> 
object, which is passed to other components so that those other
components may communicate with (make remote calls on) the component
that was exported. When examining the configuration files above, notice
that the configuration files for the lookup service 
(<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/reggie/package-summary.html"><code>Reggie</code></a>)
and the server each specifies an 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/export/Exporter.html"><i>exporter</i></a>.
From this, one can conclude that the lookup service as well as the
server each export a remote object. Note that although the client's 
configuration file doesn't specify an exporter, it happens that a remote
object actually is exported by the client component. Upon examining 
the client's configuration file, one can see that the client specifies 
a 
<a href="../../doc/api/net/jini/lookup/ServiceDiscoveryManager.html"><code>ServiceDiscoveryManager</code> (SDM)</a>.
The SDM utility exports a remote listener object, using a default 
exporter if no exporter is specified in the configuration. Of course, 
the client configuration file above could have explicitly specified an 
exporter in a way similar to what is done in the client's secure 
configurations, which can be seen by examining the files in the next 
section.
<p>
Through the configured exporter, one can specify the protocol to 
use for remote communication; in this case, JRMP or Jini ERI. Thus, 
when the remote object is exported using the exporter specified in the
configuration, a proxy is created through which the other components 
in the system can communicate with the remote object using the protocol 
that is specified with that exporter. For example, to configure a basic 
exporter that will create a proxy that communicates back to the remote 
object using JRMP, the configuration would contain an entry like the 
following:

<pre>
  exporter = new JrmpExporter();
</pre>

Compare this with an exporter that specifies its remote communication
to occur over Jini ERI,

<a name="basic-jeri-exporter"></a>
<pre>
  private static endPoint  = TcpServerEndpoint.getInstance(0);
  private static ilFactory = new BasicILFactory();

  exporter = new BasicJeriExporter(endPoint, ilFactory);
</pre>

Note that the values of the private entries in the configuration
snippet above will be automatically substituted for the parameters 
of the exporter specification when the exporter is instantiated. Using 
substitution in this way is not required; that is, the private values 
could have been entered directly in the exporter specification. Private 
entries are used here and in the other snippets presented in this 
document to aid in readability.
<p>
From the snippets above, it should be clear that one specifies the 
use of JRMP or Jini ERI by configuring either a "JRMP exporter" or a 
"Jini ERI exporter" respectively. As will be further demonstrated in the
<a href="#secure-config-files">Secure configuration files</a> section
below, when using a 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/jeri/BasicJeriExporter.html"><code>BasicJeriExporter</code></a>,
one has additional flexibility with respect to the <i>transport</i> over
which communication will occur. Through the <code>endPoint</code> 
parameter of <code>BasicJeriExporter</code>, one can specify non-secure
transports such as TCP (as was done above) and HTTP, or transports
that support security, such as SSL, HTTPS, and Kerberos.

<h3>Secure configurations</h3>

The configurations with IDs that begin with 'C' or 'D' from the
<a href="#config-table">quick start table</a> will be referred to
as <i>secure</i> configurations because access control, integrity,
and authentication are enforced when components of the system
communicate with each other under those configurations. 

<h4>Dynamic permissions, integrity, access control</h4>

To install the security policy provider included in the Apache River 
release (to enable dynamic permission granting) the secure configurations
of the lookup service, the server, and Phoenix each use the 
security properties file, 
<code><a href="config/dynamic-policy.security-properties">config/dynamic-policy.security-properties</a></code>.
<p>
With respect to the example's server component, each of that
component's secure configurations employs a specially defined
<code><a href="MdClassAnnotationProvider.java">preferred class provider</a></code>,
which uses 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/url/httpmd/package-summary.html"><i>HTTPMD URL</i>s</a>
to ensure integrity of data and downloaded 
code. Additionally, each secure configuration of the server component
specifies a <code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ServerPermission.java">ServerPermission</a></code>
to control access to the resource(s) the server provides.

<h4>Principals</h4>

Whether running one of the SSL configurations or one of the 
Kerberos configurations, each component is associated with a 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/security/Principal.html"><i>principal</i></a>
- an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/security/auth/x500/X500Principal.html">X500Principal</a>
in the case of SSL, or a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/security/auth/kerberos/KerberosPrincipal.html">KerberosPrincipal</a>
in the case of Kerberos. A principal essentially represents a
component's identity; that is, "who" the component is. 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/constraint/package-summary.html">Constraints</a>
can then be imposed and permissions can be granted based on a
component's identity. 

<h4>Constraints</h4>

One way to view constraints is as a mechanism - in conjunction 
with the standard  
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc3.html#20128">Java security policy mechanism</a>
- for expressing what a principal 
<b><i>can do</i></b>, what it <b><i>cannot do</i></b>, and/or 
what it <b><i>must do</i></b>. In particular, through constraints 
and Java security policy, the components of the example can be 
configured so that the desired security is enforced when the
components attempt to communicate with each other. For example,
before communication between two components is allowed, one 
(or both) component(s) may be required to authenticate itself 
to the other component; that is, the component may be required
to not only tell the other component <i>who</i> it is, but also
<i>prove</i> who it is. Based on who the component authenticates 
as, access to the resources of the component with which it is
communicating is either granted or refused; that is, access
is controlled based on who (what principal) is asking for that 
access.

<h4>Login configuration files</h4>

Each component of the example is associated with a different 
principal representing who that component is while it executes.
Each principal is associated with a corresponding password.
Take a look at the files in the example's 
<code><a href="./prebuiltkeys">prebuiltkeys</a></code> directory 
that have names of the form <code>*.password</code>. Notice that 
the <code>prebuiltkeys</code> directory contains no password files 
associated with the client component of the example. When running 
the example, you should observe that only the client component 
prompts for a password; thus, no password file is required for the 
client in the <code>prebuiltkeys</code> directory. This is because, 
unlike the client, the lookup service, the server, and Phoenix are 
each configured to automatically retrieve their respective passwords 
from a file, rather than from an interactive dialog box in which 
a human user supplies the principal name and appropriate password. 
<p>
Whether running an SSL configuration or a Kerberos configuration,
the authentication mechanism used is the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html">Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)</a>.
To use JAAS, a component "logs in"; a process that requires configuration.
To understand how each component of the example is configured for
JAAS login, compare the contents of the following files:
<p>
<b><i>JAAS login configuration files for SSL configurations</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-phoenix.login">config/ssl-phoenix.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-reggie.login">config/ssl-reggie.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-server.login">config/ssl-server.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-client.login">config/ssl-client.login</a></code></li>
  </ul>
<b><i>JAAS login configuration files for Kerberos configurations</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-phoenix.login">config/krb-phoenix.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-reggie.login">config/krb-reggie.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-server.login">config/krb-server.login</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-client.login">config/krb-client.login</a></code></li>
  </ul>

If you compare these files, you will see some parallels between
the SSL login configuration files and the Kerberos login 
configuration files. For example, there is an indication of the 
principal name for the corresponding component (<code>keyStoreAlias</code>
for SSL, <code>principal</code> for Kerberos), where to find the 
credentials that will be used for authentication (<code>keyStoreURL</code>
and <code>keyTab</code>), and for SSL, the location from which to 
retrieve the associated password (<code>keyStorePasswordURL</code>). 
If you examine the client's SSL login configuration file, you will
see that there is no <code>keyStorePasswordURL</code>, and its
Kerberos login configuration file sets <code>doNotPrompt</code> to
<code>false</code> (by default); both of which will cause the client's 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/security/auth/spi/LoginModule.html"><i>login module</i></a>
to prompt for a password. 

<a name="secure-config-files"><h4>Configuration files</h4></a>

As discussed previously, the secure configurations of this example
emphasize security in the face of <b><i>remote calls and downloaded code</i></b>.
Furthermore, when security is introduced into the system, it is 
introduced through a mechanism of constraints in conjunction with 
the standard security policy mechanism. Concrete examples of this
can be seen when examining and comparing the contents of the 
following configuration files:
<p>

<b><i>SSL configuration files</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-reggie.config">config/ssl-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-server.config">config/ssl-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-client.config">config/ssl-client.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>
<b><i>Kerberos configuration files</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-reggie.config">config/krb-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-server.config">config/krb-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-client.config">config/krb-client.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>

While examining the above configuration files, one should notice the 
relationship between the export process, the proxies that result from
exporting, and the constraint mechanism in conjunction with the 
standard security policy mechanism. As with the basic configurations,
each component in the example exports a remote object; thus, each 
secure configuration specifies an exporter. Furthermore, the exporter
that is configured is the mechanism through which one can specify
the security requirements that will be enforced from the point of
view of the exported remote object.
<p>
Because components that <i>receive</i> a proxy produced by an exporter
will use the proxy to communicate with the exported remote object, 
those components will want to specify the security requirements
that will be enforced from the point of view of the component that
receives and uses the proxy. Additionally, because acquisition and 
reconstruction of the proxy, as well as the invocation of any remote 
methods on the proxy, typically involve not only data transmitted 
in-band as part of the remote call, but also code downloaded 
out-of-band, enforcing <i>object</i> integrity (both <b>data</b>
and <b>code</b>) will become a priority for many components that 
interact with the proxies they receive. 
<p>
Note that whether viewing constraints from the point of view of an 
exported remote object, or from the point of view of a component 
that receives and uses the proxy associated with a remote object,
when a set of constraints specify integrity 
(<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/core/constraint/Integrity.html"><code>Integrity.YES</code></a>)
on the remote calls between a proxy and its remote object,
the integrity of both the data and any downloaded code must be 
verified. That is, during the execution of a remote call in which 
serialized objects are transmitted and reconstructed, it must be 
verified that neither the serialized data that is tranmitted in-band,
nor the code defining each object's behavior that is downloaded 
out-of-band (if any), has not been compromised.
<p>
Whereas security requirements are specified through an exporter 
for a remote object's communication, the security requirements 
for communication through a proxy are specified through what is 
referred to as a 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/security/ProxyPreparer.html"><i>proxy preparer</i></a>.
Thus, while examining the contents of the secure configuration
files above, you will notice not only exporters being specified,
but also proxy preparers. For a particular configuration file,
the exporters are specified for the remote objects that are 
exported by the specific component associated with that configuration; 
whereas the proxy preparers are specified for the proxies that 
that component receives from the other components in the system.
<p>
Upon examining the exporters specified in the secure configurations,
you will see that in addition to specifying the transport to
use, through the <i>invocation layer</i>, constraints can be
set and aspects of access control can be specified. Compare this
to the security-related items that are specified for the proxy
preparers. When configuring a proxy preparer, the following
is specified:

<ul>
  <li>Whether or not to verify that the proxy is trusted</li>
  <li>The constraints (if any) to attach to the proxy</li>
  <li>The permissions (if any) to dynamically grant to the proxy</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Exporters and security</i></b><p>

To make this discussion regarding exporters and proxy preparers 
more concrete, first consider the following snippet showing the 
configuration of an exporter one might wish to use to export the 
remote object defined by the example's server. This exporter is 
configured for SSL. Note that, as before, private entries are used 
for readability.

<pre>
  private static endPoint      = SslServerEndpoint.getInstance(0);
  private static integrityOnly = new InvocationConstraints(Integrity.YES, null);
  private static constraints   = new BasicMethodConstraints(integrityOnly);
  private static ilFactory     = new ProxyTrustILFactory(constraints, ServerPermission.class);

  exporter = new BasicJeriExporter(endPoint, ilFactory);
</pre>

This exporter is similar to the <a href="#basic-jeri-exporter">Jini ERI exporter</a>
presented in the basic configurations section. Note the 
differences though. This exporter specifies the use of 
secure sockets (SSL) for communication and, through the 
invocation layer factory, specifies that when a component 
attempts to invoke a remote method on the exported object, 
integrity must be enforced, and the component must have 
permission - specifically, a 
<a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ServerPermission.java"><code>ServerPermission</code></a> -
to access the particular method on which the invocation is
being attempted.
<p>
There are a couple of additional things to note about the 
configuration of the exporter above. First, with respect to 
the exporter's constraints, the only constraint that is 
specified is integrity. This is not an uncommon security model 
for remote server objects. Rather than using additional 
constraints to enforce access control, the strategy demonstrated 
here is to exploit the standard Java security policy mechanism 
to control access to the exported object's remote methods using 
a <a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ServerPermission.java"><code>ServerPermission</code></a>.
The second thing to note is that to change the above SSL exporter 
to a Kerberos exporter, one merely has to change the endpoint 
to a Kerberos endpoint. That is,

<pre>
  private static endPoint = KerberosServerEndpoint.getInstance(0);
</pre>

<p><b><i>Proxy preparers</i></b><p>

Next, consider a snippet showing the configuration of the proxy 
preparer one might wish to apply to the proxy the client receives
from the server (by way of the lookup service):

<pre>
  private static verifyTrust           = true;
  private static requirements          = new InvocationConstraint[] 
                                              { Integrity.YES,
                                                ClientAuthentication.YES,
                                                ServerAuthentication.YES,
                                                new ServerMinPrincipal(serverUser) };
  private static preferences           = null;
  private static invocationConstraints = new InvocationConstraints(requirements,preferences);
  private static methodConstraints     = new BasicMethodConstraints(invocationConstraints);
  private static dynamicPermissions    =
       new Permission[] { new AuthenticationPermission(clientUser,serverUser,"connect") };

  preparer = new BasicProxyPreparer(verifyTrust, methodConstraints, dynamicPermissions);
</pre>

Upon examining the snippet above, one can see that before the 
proxy of interest can be used, it must be verified that the 
proxy can be trusted. That is, the first step in proxy preparation 
is trust verification (if requested). Once it is known that the 
proxy can be trusted, constraints can be attached to the proxy. 
This example presents four constraints that represent a common 
model for proxy preparation:

<ul>
  <li>Integrity must be enforced - 
      <a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/core/constraint/Integrity.html"><code>Integrity.YES</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>The client must tell the server not only "who" it is when it attempts
      to communicate with the server, but must also <i>prove</i> to the
      server that it is who it says it is - 
      <a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/core/constraint/ClientAuthentication.html"><code>ClientAuthentication.YES</code></a>
  <li>Likewise, the server must tell the client who it is and prove it - 
      <a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/core/constraint/ServerAuthentication.html"><code>ServerAuthentication.YES</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>Although the server may prove itself to be multiple principals
      when the server proves who it is to the client, one of those 
      principals must be the principal named <code>serverUser</code> - 
      <a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/core/constraint/ServerMinPrincipal.html"><code>ServerMinPrincipal(serverUser)</code></a>
  </li>
</ul>

After trust has been established and constraints have been set,
the required permissions that allow the proxy to communicate with
the remote object must be granted to the proxy. Although the 
remote server from which the proxy originated authenticates as the 
principal <code>serverUser</code>, when the proxy is used to 
communicate back to that server, the proxy is granted 
permission to <code>connect</code> to the server as the principal 
<code>clientUser</code>. Think of the proxy as <b><i>foreign code</i></b> 
executing in the client's environment; code produced by an 
entity - the server - that authenticates as the server's principal. 
The value of the last argument of the proxy preparer configuration 
shown above specifies that the proxy is allowed to communicate back 
to that server under the client's principal; as if it were the 
client itself. The proxy is allowed to do this because the first 
step in the proxy preparation process established that the client 
trusts that proxy to act on the client's behalf.
<p>
In addition to exporters and proxy preparers, there are a number
of other items specified in the configuration files, along with
some in-line explanatory documentation. You should examine and 
compare the contents of all the configuration files.

<h3>Call confirming configurations</h3>

An additional set of configurations under which this example can be
run are what will be referred to as the <i>call confirming</i> 
configurations. Each of the call confirming configurations employs 
the Jini ERI protocol for communication, using a custom invocation 
layer factory to produce a custom invocation handler paired with a 
custom invocation dispatcher. When the client component, through the
proxy, attempts to make a remote call to the server component, the 
custom invocation handler causes a dialog window to pop up so that 
manual confirmation from the client side of the call can be performed 
before allowing the call to proceed. Similarly, after allowing the
call to proceed from the client side, when the call is dispatched 
on the server side, the dispatcher also displays a dialog window 
so that manual confirmation from the server side of the call can be 
performed before allowing the call to complete.
<p>
To see the details of how the custom invocation layer factory, the
custom dispatcher, and the custom invocation handler are implemented, 
examine the contents of the following source files.

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ConfirmingILFactory.java">ConfirmingILFactory.java</a></code> - custom IL factory with dispatcher</li>
  <li><code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ConfirmingInvocationHandler.java">ConfirmingInvocationHandler.java</a></code> - custom invocation handler</li>
</ul>

Note that the call confirming configurations span both the basic 
and secure configurations described above. That is, like the 
basic configurations, there is a call confirming configuration 
that specifies basic TCP/IP as the transport and, like the secure 
configurations, there are two call confirming configurations that 
specify SSL and Kerberos (configurations with IDs B-3, C-7, and D-10 
respectively from the <a href="#config-table">quick start table</a>).
To see the details, examine the contents of the following 
configuration files:

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="config/confirming-jeri-server.config">config/confirming-jeri-server.config</a></code></li>
  <li><code><a href="config/confirming-ssl-server.config">config/confirming-ssl-server.config</a></code></li>
  <li><code><a href="config/confirming-krb-server.config">config/confirming-krb-server.config</a></code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Activatable configurations</h3>

Another set of configurations provided with this example are what
will be referred to as the <i>activatable</i> configurations. The
distinguishing feature of the activatable configurations is that
the server component is 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/Activatable.html"><i>activatable</i></a>; 
that is, the server is configured to be executed by the 
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html">Phoenix</a>
implementation of the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/ActivationSystem.html"><i>activation system</i></a>.
<p>
To understand the explanations below, it might be instructive 
to review some terminology. As described previously, when a 
remote object is exported, a proxy object is produced. Through 
a reference to that proxy object, other components of an 
application can communicate with the exported remote object (the 
server). The proxy object is often referred to as the <i>front end</i> 
of the server, and the various aspects of its communication 
with the remote object are referred to as the <i>client side</i> 
communication. As one might expect, when the proxy is referred 
to as the front end of the server, the associated remote object 
with which that proxy communicates is referred to as the 
<i>back end</i> of the server, and its communication with the 
proxy is referred to as the <i>server side</i> communication. 
Additionally, the term <i>client</i> is generally used to 
refer to the component holding the reference to the proxy, 
but can also refer to the proxy object itself (depending on 
context). Similarly, the term <i>server</i> generally refers 
to the remote object that was exported, or the component that 
performed the export and holds the remote object. Given this 
terminology, it should come as no surprise then that this 
example provides a class named 
<a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Client.java"><code>Client</code></a> and a class
named <a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Server.java"><code>Server</code></a>.
<p>
With the above terms in mind, one way to view the activation system 
is as a "container" that can be used to execute server back ends in
shared or separate virtual machines embodied as 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/ActivationGroup.html"><i>activation groups</i></a>.
That is, the activation system (Phoenix) is started, and then 
the server one wishes to execute is registered with the 
activation system, which ultimately executes the server in a VM that 
the activation system spawns and maintains. As one might expect, 
for the example being described in this document, the only 
component with a configuration that supports this model is the 
server component. To support the server component's interaction 
with activation, the following class is provided:

<ul>
  <li><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java"><code>ActivatableServer.java</code></a></li>
</ul>

<a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java"><code>ActivatableServer</code></a>
extends <a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/Server.java"><code>Server</code></a>, providing
additional functionality for registering the server with the 
activation system. Thus, <code>ActivatableServer</code> acts as 
both the server component of this example and the mechanism used 
to register the server with the activation system. Note that this 
strategy of combining server functionality with the activation 
registration mechanism is just one possible strategy for 
implementing the activatable form of the server component. 
Another common strategy is to provide a separate registration 
mechanism (for example, the class
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/start/SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor.html"><code>SharedActivatableServiceDescriptor</code></a>
from the Apache River release's
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/start/package-summary.html"><i>service starter framework</i></a>).
<p>
As with the confirming configurations, the activatable configurations 
associated with <code>ActivatableServer</code> span both the 
basic and secure configurations described above. For the details, 
see the configurations with IDs B-4, B-5, C-8, and D-11 from the 
<a href="#config-table">quick start table</a>, and examine the 
contents of the following configuration files:
<p>

<b><i>Configuration files for <a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java">ActivatableServer</a></i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config">config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-activatable-ssl-server.config">config/start-activatable-ssl-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-activatable-krb-server.config">config/start-activatable-krb-server.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>
<b><i>Configuration files for the server component when activated</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/activatable-jeri-server.config">config/activatable-jeri-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/activatable-ssl-server.config">config/activatable-ssl-server.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/activatable-krb-server.config">config/activatable-krb-server.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>

The lists above reveal an interesting pattern for configuration 
when Phoenix is used to execute a server's back end. Notice that for
each configuration represented in the lists above (Jini ERI, SSL,
Kerberos), there are two configuration files: one that specifies the
configuration of the mechanism used to register the server with
Phoenix, and one that specifies the configuration of the server
itself. It is important to understand that each of the 
<i>start configuration</i> files from the first list specifies how 
<code>ActivatableServer</code> is to interact with Phoenix to 
register the server (in this case, to register itself) for activation, 
<b><i>not</i></b> how either Phoenix or the server are themselves 
configured. For example, if you examine 
<code><a href="config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config">config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config</a></code>,
you will see that it is in this file that one specifies the 
actual configuration to use for the server that is to be registered
and ultimately activated (look for the entry that references
<code><a href="config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config">config/activatable-jeri-server.config</a></code>).
When the server is activated, the server configures itself from the 
entries it retrieves from that second configuration. Note that it 
is also in that start configuration file that options and system 
properties can be specified for the VM in which the server runs.
<p>
To specifically configure Phoenix, for each configuration under which
Phoenix may be run in this example (JRMP, Jini ERI, SSL, Kerberos), there 
are Phoenix-specific configuration file pairs: one for configuring the
activation group created by Phoenix, and one that specifies the actual 
configuration of Phoenix itself. That is,
<p>

<b><i>Configuration files for activation group, created by Phoenix, in which server runs</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/jrmp-phoenix-group.config">config/jrmp-phoenix-group.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/jeri-phoenix-group.config">config/jeri-phoenix-group.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-phoenix-group.config">config/ssl-phoenix-group.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-phoenix-group.config">config/krb-phoenix-group.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>
<b><i>Configuration files for Phoenix itself</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/jrmp-phoenix.config">config/jrmp-phoenix.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/jeri-phoenix.config">config/jeri-phoenix.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-phoenix.config">config/ssl-phoenix.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-phoenix.config">config/krb-phoenix.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>

This pattern of configuration file pairs, where one configuration 
specifies how a server is to be started and the other configuration 
specifies the behavior of the server itself, does not apply only in 
activatable scenarios. This pattern often occurs whenever any sort
of container-type facility is used to initiate the execution of 
another component. For example, consider the lookup service 
implementation employed in this example 
(<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/reggie/package-summary.html"><code>Reggie</code></a>).
To start Reggie under any of the configurations of this example, 
a container-type application, referred to as the 
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/start/package-summary.html"><i>service starter framework</i></a>,
is used. As when Phoenix, through the
<code><a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java">ActivatableServer</a></code>
class, is used to start the activatable form of the server
component of this example, when the service starter framework is 
used to start a server such as Reggie, each configuration is 
represented by a pair of configuration files. Specifically,
<p>

<b><i>Configuration files for service starter framework used to start Reggie</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-reggie.config">config/start-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-ssl-reggie.config">config/start-ssl-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/start-krb-reggie.config">config/start-krb-reggie.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>
<b><i>Configuration files for Reggie itself</i></b>
  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="config/jrmp-reggie.config">config/jrmp-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/ssl-reggie.config">config/ssl-reggie.config</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="config/krb-reggie.config">config/krb-reggie.config</a></code></li>
  </ul>

Finally, note that because the activatable form of the server 
component actually runs in a VM (activation group) spawned by 
Phoenix, the mechanism for stopping the activatable server is 
to actually stop Phoenix. This is why the instructions in the 
<a href="#config-table">quick start table</a> indicate that a 
<i>cntrl-c</i> (kill signal) should be executed in the command 
window in which Phoenix was started, rather than the server's 
command window. Additionally, also note that to support the 
management of the environment in which the activatable server 
runs, Phoenix persists certain state. Thus, for convenience, and 
to avoid unnecessary attempts at restarting any old, unwanted 
configurations of the server component, the instructions in the 
<a href="#config-table">quick start table</a> also recommend removing 
the current persisted state (log files and directory) whenever 
Phoenix is shut down.

<h3>Security policy and access control</h3>

In the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc1.html#21150">Java security architecture</a>,
an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc4.html#20389">access control mechanism</a>
is presented in which the concept of a <i>protection domain</i>, 
encapsulated by the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/security/ProtectionDomain.html"><code>ProtectionDomain</code></a>
class, is discussed. Through the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc3.html#20128"><b><i>security policy</i></b></a>,
a protection domain is mapped to a desired set of 
<b><i>permissions</i></b>, and based on the particular security policy in place, the 
access control mechanism can be used to allow or deny 
access to various resources. To understand security policy and its relation to the protection 
domain of currently executing code, one can view it as a mechanism in which a 
set of permissions are granted to:

<ul>
  <li><i>Who</i> the code is being executed on behalf of - <b><i>principal(s)</i></b></li>
  <li><i>What</i> <b><i>class loader</i></b> has loaded the code being executed</li>
  <li><i>Where</i> the code being executed was obtained from - <b><i>code source</i></b></li>
</ul>

Note that code source is characterized not only by a 
<i>location</i> - a <code>URL</code> - but also by any 
possible <i>signers</i>.
<p>
Through the security policy, permissions may be granted to 
any combination of the items in the list above. That is,
whereas permissions may certainly be granted to a set of
classes signed by some set of signers, obtained from a 
particular <code>URL</code> and loaded by a given class loader,
and running as a particular set of principals, permisssions 
may also be granted to code simply executing on behalf of 
a set of principals, with no regard to class loader or code 
source; or to code based on only the location from which the 
code was obtained, etc.
<p>

<h4>Security policy file format</h4>

Security policy  
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/spec/security-spec.doc3.html#20131">file format</a>
provides the mechanism for specifying the "who" and "where" to 
which permissions will be granted. With respect to the "what"
of the protection domain, note that class loaders provide no
means for unique identification; therefore, there is no way to 
reference a specific class loader in a security policy file.
For example, consider the following <i>grant entries</i> that 
might appear in a security policy file:

<pre>
  grant codeBase "file:lib/phoenix.jar" principal "phoenix" {
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "shutdownHooks";
  };

  grant principal "phoenix" {
      permission com.sun.jini.phoenix.SystemPermission "com.sun.jini.phoenix.activeGroup";
      permission com.sun.jini.phoenix.SystemPermission 
                                       "java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem.activeGroup";
      permission com.sun.jini.phoenix.SystemPermission 
                                          "java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem.shutdown";
  };

  grant codebase "file:lib/phoenix.jar" {
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "getClassLoader";
      permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "getProtectionDomain";
  };

  grant {
      permission java.util.PropertyPermission "customProp1", "read";
      permission java.util.PropertyPermission "customProp2", "read";
  };

  grant codebase "file:lib/jsk-platform.jar" {
      permission java.security.AllPermission;
  };

  grant {
      permission java.security.AllPermission;
  };
</pre>

Because security policy file format does not allow one to 
specifically indicate a class loader to which to grant permissions,
the above grant entries present examples of permissions being 
granted to various combinations of principal(s) and code source. 
For example, the first entry grants the indicated permissions to 
only the code from the local JAR file indicated in the 
<code>file:</code> URL, with the additional restriction that the 
code from that source must be executing as the indicated principal. 
Compare this with the second entry. That entry grants the indicated 
permissions to code from <i>any source</i>, so long as that code is 
running as the given principal. Alternatively, in the third entry, 
the indicated permissions are granted to code running as 
<i>any principal</i>, but only so long as the code was obtained from 
the indicated code source location. 
<p>
Moving down the list, the fourth entry grants the indicated permissions 
(but only those specific permissions) to code from <i>any source</i>, 
running as <i>any principal</i>, and the entry after that, grants 
<i>all permissions</i>
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/security/AllPermission.html"><code>java.security.AllPermission</code></a>)
to specific code with no restriction on principal; that is, code from 
the specific source indicated, executing as any principal. Finally, 
the last entry grants <i>all permissions</i> to <i>all code</i>, no 
matter what principal(s) that code may, or may not, be running as.
<p>

<h4>Terminology</h4>

In the discussions below, the term <i>party</i> (or <i>parties</i>) may 
be used at times to generally refer to the entities to which a particular 
set of permissions are granted. For example, when discussing a grant
entry like the first one above, one might refer to granting the 
permissions contained in that entry to the <i>party</i> who is both
located at <code>lib/phoenix.jar</code>, and who has logged in (or 
authenticated) as the principal <code>phoenix</code>. Similarly, when 
discussing the second grant entry, one might talk about granting 
the indicated permissions to any parties who have simply authenticated 
as the principal <code>phoenix</code>.

<h4>Security policy principles</h4>

The following principles embody the general philosophy of the 
security policy demonstrated in this example through the configurations 
and security policy files discussed below. The model presented here 
is general in nature and fairly broad in its applicability. Therefore, 
your own applications may require the specification of a different set 
of principles.

<ol>
  <li><i>All permissions</i> is <b><i>never ever</i></b> granted to all 
      parties (any code source, any principal).
  </li>
  <li><i>All permissions</i> is only granted to parties from <i>local</i>,
      trusted sources.
  </li>
  <li>For non-secure configurations, under certain conditions, 
      <i>specific permissions</i> may be granted to all parties 
      (all code, any principal).
  </li>
  <li>For secure configurations, server-side access control is provided
      through security policy. That is, from the <i>server side</i> of a
      remote call, <i>access permission</i> allowing the invocation of 
      a remote method should only be granted to parties who are trusted 
      to make use of that method.
  </li>
</ol>

Recall that the security model specified by Jini technology 
provides mechanisms that emphasize security in the face of 
<b><i>remote calls and downloaded code</i></b>. Each of the 
principles above attempts to acknowledge this aspect of security 
policy in a Jini technology-based application.

<p>
<b><i>Principle 1 - never grant "all permissions" to all parties</i></b>
<p>
To understand the importance of the first principle, consider the 
situation where that principle is violated. When an entity grants
"all permissions" to all code, the code to which "all permissions" is
granted will include any code that is downloaded from remote sources; 
that is, <i>foreign</i> code, which is not necessarily trusted. This 
can pose a significant security risk because access to all of the 
granting entity's resources is being provided to parties that may 
be both unknown and untrusted. Thus, to prevent exposure to the
risks presented when "all permissions" is granted to all code, each 
of the <a href="#all-policy-files">policy files</a> provided with 
this example satisfies the first principle.
<p>
<b><i>Principle 2 - only grant "all permissions" to local code</i></b>
<p>
The second principle is designed to provide some flexibility to the
policy, without sacrificing security. What is meant by the term 
<i>local code</i>, as it is used in that principle, is code that has 
been obtained from a trusted source and that has been installed locally 
on your system. For example, consider the JDK (or JRE) code you are
running. Presumably, you obtained this code from a vendor that you 
trust will not supply a JDK or JRE that does "bad things". Even if 
the version of Java you are using was not installed by you, it was 
probably pre-installed by the (trusted) vendor who supplied your
system. Similarly, the Apache River release itself was obtained from a 
trusted source (the Jini team), and was installed by someone you must 
certainly trust - you! Code that is installed and runs locally (including 
your own application code) can be safely granted "all permissions" 
because you know its source, and you trust that it will not behave 
badly.
<p>
Another way of viewing local code is as "code that is <b><i>not downloaded</i></b> 
during the execution of the application". To understand this, consider 
the policy file for both the 
<a href="config/reggie.policy">basic configuration</a> and the 
<a href="config/ssl-reggie.policy">SSL configuration</a> of Reggie
from the <a href="#all-policy-files">lists below</a>. In both files, 
you will see that "all permissions" is granted to the JAR files from only
the <a href="../../lib"><code>lib</code></a> directory
of the Apache River release, with no entries granting "all permissions" to  
<code>http: URL</code>s referencing any of the JAR files from the 
<a href="../../lib-dl"><code>lib-dl</code></a> directory.
Recall that files such as <code>jsk-platform.jar</code>, 
<code>reggie.jar</code>, etc. are contained in the Apache River release's 
<code>lib</code> directory whereas only <i>downloadable</i> JAR 
files (such as <code>jsk-dl.jar</code>, <code>reggie-dl.jar</code>, etc.) 
are contained in the <code>lib-dl</code> directory. The pattern
promoted by the Apache River release is that the JAR files from the 
<code>lib</code> directory are expected to be locally installed, 
not downloaded; whereas the JAR files contained in the <code>lib-dl</code> 
directory are expected to be downloaded. Thus, another way of stating 
the second principle is, "never grant <i>all permissions</i> to downloaded code".
<p>
<b><i>Principle 3 - specific permissions may be granted to all parties (non-secure configurations)</i></b>
<p>
With respect to an application of the third principle, one might 
wonder why configurations that are labelled as "non-secure" are 
concerned with fine grained security such as that expressed in the 
principle; or any security at all for that matter. It should be
clear from the first two principles that the term "non-secure", 
as it is applied to the configurations described in this document, 
does not equate with "no security at all". Rather, that term is 
meant to imply that the mechanisms of the Jini technology security 
model, mechanisms that provide items such as authentication, authorization, 
confidentiality, integrity, and trust verification, are not employed
when remote calls are made and code is downloaded. But this does
not mean that access to all other aspects of an entity's resources
should be granted to other parties. The position taken by this
example, as expressed in the third principle, is that it still
makes good sense to use the mechanisms of the standard Java 
security model to allow open access to only those resources that 
are necessary and can be considered low risk. In this way, 
functionality can be provided while minimizing one's vulnerability 
to attacks from third parties.
<p>
A concrete example of the third principle above can be seen in the
<a href="config/phoenix.policy">policy file</a> for the basic 
configuration of Phoenix. In that file you will notice an 
entry that grants various instances of
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/ExecOptionPermission.html"><code>ExecOptionPermission</code></a>
to all parties. To understand the need for that permission, recall
that Phoenix spawns a VM, referred to as an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/ActivationGroup.html"><i>activation group</i></a>,
in which the server to be activated will be executed. When starting
the activation group, a number of options and properties are usually 
set. To see the properties and options that are set for the activation 
group under the basic configuration, examine the contents of the 
<a href="config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config">configuration file</a> 
for the class that is used to start the activatable form of the 
server under Jini ERI. To see how those options and properties 
are actually set, take a look at the code in 
<a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java"><code>ActivatableServer.java</code></a>.
<p>
In order to register the server with Phoenix for activation, a 
proxy to the activation system is obtained and, through the remote
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/ActivationSystem.html#registerGroup(java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupDesc)"><code>registerGroup</code></a>
method on that proxy, an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/activation/ActivationGroupDesc.html"><i>activation group descriptor</i></a>,
containing the necessary options and properties, is registered with 
Phoenix. For simplicity (to avoid the complications that can
arise when separating the server's classpath and codebase from that
of the activation group), the classpath and codebase properties that
the <code>ActivatableServer</code> sets for the activation group are 
also the classpath used to execute the server, and the codebase used to 
annotate the server's classes. Thus, after identifying the options and
properties specified in the 
<a href="config/start-activatable-jeri-server.config">configuration file</a>,
and then examining the contents of Phoenix's <a href="config/phoenix.policy">policy file</a> 
as well as the source from <a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ActivatableServer.java"><code>ActivatableServer.java</code></a>,
the role of <code>ExecOptionPermission</code> should be apparent. Using 
<code>ExecOptionPermission</code>, Phoenix expresses the access control 
policy for what activation group descriptors can be registered. That is, 
through <code>ExecOptionPermission</code>, Phoenix controls which options 
and properties can be set. 
<p>
In the case of the non-secure configurations, the reason that Phoenix 
grants the various instances of <code>ExecOptionPermission</code> 
to all parties rather than specific parties is because the 
registration is performed through a remote call made by an entity 
with no client subject; that is, the entity does not authenticate
as any principal(s) to Phoenix. Because there are no principals to
which Phoenix can grant the required permissions, and because
the source of the code making the call is not in Phoenix's access 
control context, the necessary permissions must be granted to the 
empty protection domain (any principal, any code source); otherwise 
Phoenix's access control policy will reject the call. Compare this 
to the policy files provided with the secure configurations of 
Phoenix. When interacting with Phoenix under the secure configurations, 
the activatable form of the server authenticates itself to Phoenix 
as the principal <code>server</code>, and in Phoenix's associated 
policy files, the necessary instances of <code>ExecOptionPermission</code> 
are granted to any code source that authenticates as that specific 
principal. As described below, this is a result of the fourth principle.
<p>
Before discussing the fourth principle, another question that might
have occurred while examining Phoenix's non-secure configurations
in light of the third principle is why, in the file 
<a href="config/jeri-phoenix-group.config"><code>config/jeri-phoenix-group.config</code></a>, 
is the Phoenix activation group configured to export 
its <code>ActivationInstantiator</code> with an 
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/AccessILFactory.html"><code>AccessILFactory</code></a>
rather than a 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/jeri/BasicILFactory.html"><code>BasicILFactory</code></a>?
As explained in the 
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/phoenix/package-summary.html">Phoenix documentation</a>,
by default, the activation group exports itself as a JRMP unicast 
remote object, which is a limitation of the existing activation 
system design. If the configuration for the activation group 
specifies an exporter for the <code>ActivationInstantiator</code>
through the configuration entry named <code>instantiatorExporter</code>, 
the activation group is unexported from the JRMP runtime and then 
re-exported using the exporter specified in the configuration. So
this explains why an exporter that employs Jini ERI is specified
for that configuration. To understand why that exporter is 
configured to use an <code>AccessILFactory</code> rather than a 
<code>BasicILFactory</code>, recall that <code>BasicILFactory</code> 
returns an invocation dispatcher that accepts calls from <i>any host</i> 
(local or remote), whereas <code>AccessILFactory</code> returns an 
invocation dispatcher that only accepts calls from the local host.
Thus, by configuring the exporter for the <code>ActivationInstantiator</code>
to employ an <code>AccessILFactory</code>, additional control can
be enforced on access to the activation group.
<p>
<b><i>Principle 4 - server-side access control is provided through security policy (secure configurations)</i></b>
<p>
The fourth principle of the policy employed in this example
addresses the issue of restricting access to remote calls; that is,
granting or denying permission to invoke a remote method on an object.
Recall that the proxy through which a remote call is made is created 
when a remote object is exported, and is obtained by the caller 
through some means (for example, through a lookup service). As noted 
previously, such a call is initiated on the <i>client side</i> of 
the remote call, and is ultimately executed on the <i>server side</i>, 
in the remote object that was exported. It is the policy file of the 
remote object on the server side of the call that is addressed by this 
last principle. Rather than configuring the object's exporter with 
constraints to enforce access control, the remote object uses policy 
and access permissions to restrict access to each of its remote methods 
to only those parties who are trusted to make use of that method.
<p>
To see a concrete example of the fourth principle, examine the 
contents of any of the policy files for the secure configurations
from the <a href="#all-policy-files">lists below</a>. In 
particular, take a look at the following snippets from the policy
files for the SSL configuration of the 
<a href="config/ssl-client.policy">client component</a>, the
<a href="config/ssl-server.policy">server component</a>, and the
<a href="config/ssl-reggie.policy">lookup service</a>:

<p>
<b><i>Client policy</i></b>
<pre>
  grant principal "reggie" {
      permission net.jini.security.AccessPermission "notify";
      permission net.jini.security.AccessPermission "getProxyVerifier";
  };
</pre>

<p>
<b><i>Server policy</i></b>
<pre>
  grant principal "client" {
      permission com.sun.jini.example.hello.ServerPermission "sayHello";
  };
  grant {
      permission com.sun.jini.example.hello.ServerPermission "getProxyVerifier";
  };
</pre>

<p>
<b><i>Lookup service policy</i></b>
<pre>
  grant {
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "getProxyVerifier";
  };
  grant principal "server" {
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "register";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "cancelServiceLease";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "renewServiceLease";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "cancelLeases";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "renewLeases";
  };
  grant principal "client" {
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "lookup";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "notify";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "cancelEventLease";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "renewEventLease";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "cancelLeases";
      permission com.sun.jini.reggie.RegistrarPermission "renewLeases";
  };
</pre>

To help with understanding the grant entries in the snippets 
above, a review of the remote interactions between the 
components of this example might be of value. When running 
under the secure configurations, the server component, 
represented by the principal named <code>server</code>, and 
the client component, represented by the principal named 
<code>client</code>, both invoke various remote methods on 
the lookup service, represented by the principal named 
<code>reggie</code>. As for the interaction between the 
client and server, that interaction is restricted to the 
client's invocation of the server's remote methods; the 
server makes no remote calls on the client. Finally, although 
the lookup service makes no remote calls into the server 
component, the lookup service does make remote calls into 
the client.
<p>
To understand how the lookup service makes remote calls into
the client, recall that because this example's client component 
wishes to receive remote events from the lookup service, it 
registers a remote event listener with the lookup service. 
Thus, the client must export a remote listener object whose 
proxy will be used by the lookup service to make remote calls 
back into the client to provide the client with event notifications. 
This means that with respect to the client's participation in the 
lookup service's event mechanism, the client is actually on the 
server side of the remote calls, and the lookup service is on 
the client side. 
<p>
The next thing to consider when examining the grant entries above
is the 
<a href="../../doc/api/net/jini/security/AccessPermission.html"><code>AccessPermission</code></a>
class. That class represents permission to invoke the remote method
whose name is indicated in the target component of the permission.
In the client snippet above, there is a single entry in which
the principal <code>reggie</code> is granted permission to invoke 
two remote methods on the listener proxy provided by the client 
component: <code>getProxyVerifier</code> and <code>notify</code>.
Permission to invoke the listener's <code>getProxyVerifier</code> 
method must be granted so that the lookup service can perform
trust verification on that listener's proxy, and permission to 
invoke the listener's <code>notify</code> method must be granted 
so that the lookup service can send events to the client.
<p>
Upon comparing the snippet from the client's policy file to 
the remaining snippets, one will notice that whereas the client 
policy uses <code>AccessPermission</code> to control who can invoke 
the client's remote methods, both the server and the lookup service 
enforce that control using their own custom subclasses of 
<code>AccessPermission</code> (the subclasses 
<a href="src/com/sun/jini/example/hello/ServerPermission.java"><code>ServerPermission</code></a>
and
<a href="../../doc/api/com/sun/jini/reggie/RegistrarPermission.html"><code>RegistrarPermission</code></a>
respectively).
Using a simple subclass of 
<code>AccessPermission</code> such as those used in this example 
is a common mechanism that entities can use to express separation 
of grants for the various remote objects those entities export. 
The choice of using <code>AccessPermission</code> or a custom 
subclass is a matter of taste, and thus, is left to the discretion 
of the developer; although this example employs a common 
pattern whereby only the servers (the hello service and the lookup 
service) use a custom, server-specific permission. 
<p>
The last thing to understand in the snippets above is "who"
is being granted permission to invoke the indicated remote 
methods provided by the associated component. Considering how
the components interact with each other in this example, the 
pattern should not be surprising. In general, the parties who are
granted the permissions represent the entities from which 
the granting entity expects to receive remote calls. Additionally, 
rather than granting such parties permission to call all remote 
methods provided by the granting entity, those parties are granted 
permission to call only those methods the granting entity expects 
a particular party to need. The criteria used to determine the 
parties and the permissions they should be granted is generally 
based on the granting entity's perception of a particular party's 
"role" or expected model of interaction, together with the general 
level of risk that access to particular methods might pose to the 
granting entity. Organizing grant entries in this way allows the 
entity to express its access control policy as a 
<i>separation of concerns</i>.
<p>
Once again, consider the client policy. Because the client expects 
only the lookup service to interact with it using the remote event 
listener exported by the client, the client grants to the principal 
<code>reggie</code> (and only that principal), permission to call 
the two remote methods provided by the listener. Compare this with 
the lookup service's policy. With respect to how each interacts with
the lookup service, the concerns of the client are separate from 
those of the server. That is, there are methods the client is 
allowed to call that the server is not allowed to call, and vice 
versa. Additionally, although there is no overlap of concerns in 
this particular case, there is nothing to preclude two components
such as this example's client and server from also needing access 
to a number of common methods in order to fulfill their respective 
roles as Jini technology-enabled client and service.
<p>
When examining the snippets from the lookup service's policy and
the server's policy, one might wonder why the entries that grant 
permission to call <code>getProxyVerifier</code> grant that 
permission to all parties, rather than a specific principal, as 
was done in the client's policy. Recall that when running under the secure 
configurations, before using a proxy, that proxy should be 
<i>prepared</i>; where the first step in proxy preparation is 
verifying that the proxy can be trusted. A fundamental element 
of trust verification is an object referred to as a 
<a href="../../doc/api/net/jini/security/TrustVerifier.html"><i>trust verifier</i></a>.
With respect to the remote object that provides the proxy, the 
trust verification mechanism defined in the Jini technology 
security model requires that some means be provided for 
other parties to verify that the proxy can be trusted. In this 
example, each remote object provides that means through the 
implementation of the 
<a href="../../doc/api/net/jini/security/proxytrust/ProxyTrust.html"><code>ProxyTrust</code></a>
interface, which requires the remote object to implement the 
remote method
<a href="../../doc/api/net/jini/security/proxytrust/ProxyTrust.html#getProxyVerifier()"><code>getProxyVerifier</code></a>.
Thus, each component that exports a remote object must grant
permission to call that method to any parties that are expected
to attempt to verify trust in the resulting proxy. 
<p>
The policy snippets above express two different philosophies 
regarding who to grant permission to call <code>getProxyVerifier</code>.
The first philosphy says that permission to call <i>any</i> 
remote method - including <code>getProxyVerifier</code> - should 
only be granted to specific principals. The client's policy is
an example of this first philosphy. Both the server's policy 
and the lookup service's policy are examples of the second 
philosophy, which allows for all parties to be granted permission 
to call certain low risk methods. This allows for better separation 
of concerns, and can be a bit more flexible and convenient. This 
example takes the position that both philosophies have merit;
therefore, the fourth security policy principle presented above 
was written to allow for both.
<p>
Note that the method <code>getProxyVerifier</code> is considered 
low risk, no matter who calls it, because all that method allows 
the calling party to do is verify trust in the proxy. There is 
nothing more that can be done through that method. Thus, with 
respect to the invocation of  <code>getProxyVerifier</code>, all 
parties are considered trusted (as required by the fourth principle).
<p>
Finally, one might observe that unlike the policy presented in this
example, other applications specify a very fine grained policy,
in which only the minimum set of permissions that are needed are 
granted in the policy file; no more, no less. As alluded to above,
such a policy can be quite inflexible when addressing code changes
that require new permissions be granted. This is because to 
accommodate any new permissions resulting from changes to code
running under a fine grained policy, changes in the various policy 
files will also be required. Thus, although not necessarily the 
appropriate model for every application, the principles followed 
by the policy employed in this example provide a flexible mechanism 
that allows for a wide array of changes in the future.
<p>
For easy reference, a list of all of the policy files employed in 
the various configurations of this example follows:

  </ul>

<h3>Preferred list(s)</h3>

The downloadable JAR file of the server component of this example 
(<code>server-dl.jar</code>) specifies preferred classes to be
recognized by a
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/loader/pref/package-summary.html"><i>preferred class loader</i></a>
implementation to ensure that the downloaded versions of invocation 
handlers and proxy classes are used. The loader implementation employed
in this example is the 
<a href="../../doc/specs/api/net/jini/loader/pref/PreferredClassLoader.html"><code>PreferredClassLoader</code></a>
class, and the preferred settings are specified by the following file:

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="config/META-INF/PREFERRED.LIST">config/META-INF/PREFERRED.LIST</a></code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Logging</h3>

Logging is performed in this example using the Java platform's
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html">core logging facilities</a>.
This example does not specify any of its own 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/logging/Logger.html">loggers</a>.
All logging that occurs in this example occurs through the various 
loggers specified in the Apache River release itself, which are configured
using the following 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html#1.8">logger configuration file</a>:

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="config/logging.properties">config/logging.properties</a></code></li>
</ul>

In that file, all loggers are initially commented out, and
so are configured to log at a default 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html#1.2">log level</a>
of <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html">INFO</a>.
To modify the levels of each logger, simply edit the above file,
and then un-comment the desired logger(s), and set the current
level to the desired level. For example, to turn on <i>all</i> 
logging related to Jini ERI processing, change the line,

<pre>
  # net.jini.jeri.level = INFO
</pre>

to

<pre>
  net.jini.jeri.level = FINEST
</pre>
